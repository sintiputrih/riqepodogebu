He is six-foot-three and dressed smartly and simply in a tweed cap, black Nike sneakers, gray jeans, and a black long-sleeved shirt — that fits perfectly. Have you seen him on <i>Luther</i>, the British TV series in which he plays a brilliant but possibly sociopathic London police detective prone to violence and fervent ardor, often in the same instance? Good. Think of that non-posh British accent caressing the words below. Throw in a brilliant smile or a hearty chuckle at will. This was what it was like, dear readers, to spend an hour and a half with Idris Elba on his whirlwind press day for Ridley Scott’s <i>Prometheus</i>, which also happened to be his “day off” from shooting <i>No Good Deed</i>, before moving to South Africa to play Nelson Mandela in <i>The Long Walk Home</i>. We already wrote about our Elba encounter <a href=#>here in detail</a>. Below are the raw goods. Set your image of him. Is it beautiful? Now off we go.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-3-0-0@published data-word-count=43><b>I heard you were working until four this morning in Atlanta before taking a plane to New York.

Sam Miller, who directed the second installment of <i>Luther</i>, he’s directing it. It feels good.

So, the person that you see in front of you, the character that I’m playing in <i>No Good Deed</i>, and I’m prepping for Mandela as well at the same time. I’m sort of split. I’ve been training quite a bit as well, so trying to fit that in, because Mandela used to box. So, I’ve been boxing. There’s not much sleep right now. Not many friends around me. There’s not really any time. I’m sort of doing, like, 28-hour days.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-7-0-0@published data-word-count=51><b>When I think of Nelson Mandela, his being a fit guy is not the first thing that comes to mind.</b><br>When he was younger he was incredibly fit.

So how do you manage to see her?</b><br>A lot of organization. Sort of time management, basically. It doesn’t feel as organic as normal parenting. It’s like, “Oh, Dad, can I talk to you?” Yeah. You have to sort of allocate time and do things in a way that allows me and her to hang out. But we manage it. This shoot was definitely designed so that I could be at home for a while.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-10-0-0@published data-word-count=19><b>You’re going to have to go to South Africa a few days from now?</b><br>Next week, yeah.

It’s just one of those things, the biggest film in the world and biggest event of the world and I can’t be at either. I definitely wanted to be at the Olympics. It’s in my neighborhood where I grew up, in Hackney, and I’ve done some work with the Olympic team as an ambassador. So I certainly feel like I should be there.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-21-0-0@published data-word-count=63><b>Tell me about shooting <i>Prometheus</i>.</b><br>I play Captain Janek, who is the captain of the ship basically, central to most story lines but not heavy in all story lines. Good part. Very much a working man. Everyone else in the film has sort of a scientific background or whatever. But my guy’s an engineer. He’s a pilot, flew war planes and now flies spaceships.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-22-0-0@published data-word-count=38><b>He wears a hoodie sweatshirt while everyone else seems to be in more standard space uniforms.</b><br>That’s the idea. We want you to feel like you’re looking at longshoremen or sea men that travel for long periods of time.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-23-0-0@published data-word-count=128><b>It seems like a lot of what you had to do was maybe stand in front of a green screen and pretend like you were seeing space. What was it like to shoot all that stuff?</b><br>Well, the actual spaceship was built. Not in its entirety, but all its interiors are full formed, built to scale, real size, functional. Ridley [Scott] wants the actors to feel as real as it can be. The green-screen acting was only outside of the windows, when I did the spaceship taking off and landing, that type of stuff. To be honest, it didn’t affect me this much. In <i>Thor</i>, for example, when I was in that, there was a lot of green screen. You’re literally talking to an actor with nothing around you.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-24-0-0@published data-word-count=85><b>What made you want to do <i>Prometheus</i>?</b><br>I wanted to work with Ridley again. I loved working with him the first time [in <i>American Gangster</i>]. His return to this genre is a landmark in filmmaking. So to be a part of that certainly it feels like a big achievement for me. Ridley called me and said, “Look, this film isn’t about Captain Janek at all. But I want a really good actor to play this part.” So, he gave me the job and it was great.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-25-0-0@published data-word-count=14><b>This might be, like, your biggest movie.</b><br>Biggest movie that I’m in, not biggest part.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-26-0-0@published data-word-count=107><b>You did two sci-fi things back-to-back, <i>Pacific Rim</i> and this. How did the monsters compare?</b><br>Well, Guillermo del Toro’s film is much more an Earth/human story with the looming attack of another race. Very different. Guillermo del Toro is an amazing director to work with. I learned so much about precision from him — about looking at you now and then looking one layer behind you at the leaves and then looking at the wall behind you and then looking at shadows on the wall. My depth of field is now so unbelievably clear I feel like I want to direct now because of what Guillermo taught me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-27-0-0@published data-word-count=106><b>Really? What were the various things that you learned from him?</b><br>His attention to detail is amazing. His attention to sort of how to manipulate the audience to keep driving them forward in the story. As an actor, you kind of say the words, but he wanted us to really connect to each emotion. Whether the last time you saw me on the screen was six minutes ago or not, there was a real sort of connection to each one any time you were seeing me. That’s not something you teach, but it’s something that I was aware that he was paying attention to. It was interesting.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-28-0-0@published data-word-count=138><b>What does your character do?</b><br>He’s yet another man of authority, but this time much higher up. He’s the head of the army and the army is the essential fighting force against these monsters. The world is crumbled and this alien lived underneath the surface of the Earth for a long time. Our only defense has been these massive robots that fight back — they’re basically tanks that are put together to look like men and can walk. I play the leader of that sort of movement. Then we lose our funding, basically, and the world decides to build walls around countries, which basically means the rich can get in and the poor can’t. So our characters go, “No. We’re going to fight this our way.” It could be a box-standard, fight-against-the-aliens sort of film, but not with Guillermo.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-29-0-0@published data-word-count=39><b>It sounds like it’s almost a commentary on class and immigration.</b><br>Well, it’s certainly a commentary on if the world were under attack who would survive and who wouldn’t. Interestingly enough, the poor would probably more survive than the rich.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-30-0-0@published data-word-count=39><b>Why is that?</b><br>Because they have less and are used to less; therefore, more resilient and more tough. If an alien attacks a big skyscraper, people in the skyscraper are going to die. The people on the floor may not.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-31-0-0@published data-word-count=36><b><i>Pac Rim</i></b><b> takes place 20 to 30 years in the future.

I’ve been acting for twenty years. What keeps me going is the fact that I want to do something I haven’t done before. I’m not a household name and I love that because it keeps me … it allows me to keep growing and breathing. No one goes, “Oh, it’s Idris Elba’s movie.” Or “It’s an Elba picture,” or “It’s typical Elba.” At this point, even though the films are getting bigger, I’m not getting more famous. That’s an interesting position it be in as an actor. You’re doing more, you’re recognized as a great actor, but you’re not a household name.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-34-0-0@published data-word-count=12><b>You’re kind of a household name in the households that I know.</b><br>Really?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-35-0-0@published data-word-count=77><b>I mean, all my friends love <i>The Wire</i>.

So, Luther gave me not only a confidence, but a showcase to kind of go, <i>Oh yeah, that’s right, I do make up these other characters and can act. </i>Plus, it changed the kind of people that were calling.

Stringer, on the page, he read like the consigliore, the man next to the man. But I sophisticated Stringer up with how subtle he was. Luther — he’s way bigger [in his reactions] than an English cop would ever be. He’s very American-esque in that way.

That sort of handsome leading-man actor with a lifelong career because everyone adores him, audiences have moved on from that. They like more fresh faces. I’m not saying that’s over completely, but it’s definitely not as abundant as it was before. I feel like I come from a school of actors like — what’s my man’s name? — Bradley Cooper. It’s a school that’s come from good ensemble acting and television backgrounds. It’s just a longer process. They don’t pop up in one movie and suddenly they’re a superstar.

It’s not in stone yet, but it’s something we definitely want to aim towards.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-88-0-0@published data-word-count=69><b>When you say that you want to just keep playing things you haven’t played before, what are the roles that you need to tick off on your bucket list?</b><br>I haven’t done any romantic comedies. I haven’t done many comedies. I’d like to do some films skewed towards children. I love kids and kids like me, so I’d like to do something a bit silly and in that world.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-89-0-0@published data-word-count=56><b>I wonder if Stringer or Luther sort of makes people not think of you in those?</b><br>Yeah. I’m not getting offered roles by Disney at all. [Laughs.] But I’d love to try something like that. I admire Dwayne Johnson, the Rock, and those type of films are such fun. My daughter loves those type of films.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-90-0-0@published data-word-count=51><b>What do you admire about Dwayne Johnson?</b><br>Oh, just his fearlessness in taking roles like that. He’s known for being a hard man and he has a fearless approach to playing roles that are the opposite of that. That’s great to me. That shows versatility. I like him, I like that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a409687af1b1174a547d3853f7d38815-91-0-0@published data-word-count=37><b>I don’t know if you know about this, but there’s a bit of an online movement to get you on <i>The Good Wife</i>.

Think about it! Though I think you’ll be shooting Mandela when they’d need you.

I just find him depraved and horrible. But our goal is the audience has to like him even though they know he’s done heinous shit.
