He introduced himself as a mama’s boy on the show but what is his real job? How old is he? Who are his parents? Does he have a girlfriend?</p><p>The answer unfolds as this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Meet Dylan Scanlon, Player #65 From Netflix’s Squid Game: The Challenge</strong></h3><p>Dylan Scanlon, also known as Player #065, unexpectedly left the game during the Marbles round on Netflix’s Squid Game: The Challenge. Although all the pairs in the challenge were able to reach a consensus on how the outcome was to be determined, he and his companion Aurora (Player399) could not agree on how to approach the task. As the clock was running down, the two attempted to play a game together, but they were unable to decide on a single winner, which led to their elimination.</p><p>When Dylan made the decision to gamble with his future, a lot was at stake. “I left for the show with $3.91 in my bank account (I have a screenshot) and rent due right when filming ended, with no job at the time lined up,” he said.</p><p>However, after being eliminated, he has been focused on developing himself.</p><p>“I have been at my acting studio taking classes nonstop,” Dylan told Tudum. “I have also been focusing on my personal fitness and working out with my Great Dane Yung Duggy.”</p><p>But Dylan has come to understand that these objectives aren’t really for his personal enrichment as a result of taking part in Squid Game: The Challenge. “I realized that everything I do in life is not for me, but for my family. Every dream and goal I have I can push further when I have younger siblings watching me and parents supporting me so I cannot let them down.”</p><p>But in the end, his determination to stand by his beliefs cost him the award because he and Marbles’ partner Aurora (399) couldn’t agree on a game to play or, more importantly, a winner at the last minute. Dylan, nevertheless, is not sorry about the way he played.</p><p><i>“</i>Besides the winner, I genuinely feel I am the only person who did not lose <i>Squid Game: The Challenge</i>,” Dylan said. “I won the physical games, I won the social games, and I won the mental battles. There is not much one can do when someone refuses to compete with you on a competition show.”</p><h3><strong>Dylan Scanlon Age</strong></h3><p>In January 2023, Dylan Scanlon reached age 24.</p><h3><strong>Dylan Scanlon Job</strong></h3><p>Dylan Scanlon is an actor by profession.
