Add in garlic and cook for 1 minute longer. You never want to saute garlic for too long or it can become brown and bitter. No one likes brown and bitter garlic.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Make a roux by adding more butter, flour, and chicken broth</strong>. This is the base of the soup and helps to thicken it. You may substitute cornstarch for flour if you are looking to make this gluten-free.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Add in seasonings, fresh broccoli, carrots, and half-n-half</strong>. A quick and easy tip is to use a food processor to cut up your onions, garlic, carrots, and broccoli. It is a huge time saver! You just need to pulse it once or twice. After the liquid is added, let the soup simmer and thicken.</li><li><strong>The key to making this extra creamy and not ending up with a grainy texture, is to add your cheese in small amounts.</strong> You want to add the cheese in 1/2 cup increments and stir well in between each addition.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Here are some favorite soup recipes:</h3><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cheesy Cauliflower Soup</strong></a><br><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Creamy Tomato Basil Soup</strong></a><br><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Creamy Spinach Artichoke Soup</strong></a></span></span></span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Broccoli-Cheddar-Soup-Recipe.png alt="Broccoli Cheddar Soup Creamy Broccoli Cheddar Soup made with fresh broccoli, cream, and sharp cheddar cheese.
