However, be sure that after 24 hours, you resume your normal watering schedule. Otherwise, your plants might not be able to get the water they need to fully benefit from that fertilizer. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on terra-lawn-care.com</a><h2>Can I fertilize my lawn every 2 weeks?</h2>Can I fertilize my lawn every 2 weeks? To avoid over-fertilizing, applying a fertilizer every two weeks is not recommended. Fertilizing as often as every two weeks will likely lead to problems such as lawn burn, excessive grass growth, as well as polluted water that can lead to toxic algae growth. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on theturfgrassgroup.com</a><h2>Is it OK if it rains after you fertilize?</h2>On the positive side, the rain can help the fertilizer soak into the soil, providing essential nutrients to the grass. However, if the rain is too heavy, it can lead to runoff, causing the fertilizer to be washed away before it has a chance to benefit the lawn. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Is morning dew enough to water in fertilizer?</h2>Despite it falling, you should fertilize your lawn early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid the high midday temperature.

Aerating your soil before fertilizing can also help; the best times to aerate are when your grass is actively growing, such as in spring or early fall. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on scotts.com</a><h2>What is the best lawn fertilizer schedule?</h2>When to Fertilize Your Lawn.
