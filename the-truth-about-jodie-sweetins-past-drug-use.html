The "Redefining Love" actor revealed on the "<a href=#>Allison Interviews</a>" podcast that she used to turn to drugs and alcohol in order to deal with her anxiety and depression.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"There can just be a raging, screaming voice in your head all the time [and] you just ... want it to be quiet up there," she explained, adding,&nbsp;"Having that wiring in your brain ... something switches on when you're an alcoholic, where it's like, 'There's never enough. I can't ever fill this hole, 'cause there's a bottom ... missing in the cup.'" Yet, getting sober, going to therapy, learning coping skills, and finding the right prescription drugs helped, with Sweetin revealing, "For me, medication has been key."</p><p dir=ltr>For Sweetin, finally being able to be open about her anxiety and depression has help aid in her recovery, too, as she expressed gratitude for discussions surrounding mental health becoming more destigmatized in recent years. The star has even taken to Instagram to share moments when she's struggled to bring more awareness to the issue. Alongside&nbsp;<a href=#>a 2019 photo</a>&nbsp;of her and her daughters, Sweetin wrote in part, "This is a picture of a mom who had a full panic attack in the bathroom that day. ... Remember that mental illness and pain doesn't always look like what it should. ... Be kind. Be a safe space."</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, please contact the <a href=#>Crisis Text Line</a> by texting HOME to 741741, call the <a href=#>National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264), or visit the <a href=#>National Institute of Mental Health website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2llaYJ3e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2fvKW1xGaqsJ2Vqbavv4ypmKysXZm%2FtrOMrqqeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marielle-woods-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-190347-html.html><span>←</span><span>Marielle Woods Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
