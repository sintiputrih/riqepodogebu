I was expected to go and chat with him for half an hour and I ended up having a good two hours with him.

The way he described it, he was very generous with the people involved and very professional, and knew there was a clash of strategy between himself and Amanda Thirsk.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Scoop fact vs fiction: Prince Andrew's teddies, Queen's hair comb and more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9672b3c68548-scoop-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Scoop fact vs fiction: Prince Andrew's teddies, Queen's hair comb and more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Scoop fact vs fiction: Prince Andrew's teddies, Queen's hair comb and more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Scoop's Sam McAlister opens up about the 'real' Amanda Thirsk and relationship after she lost job at palace" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/787831cbb5f0-sam-mcalister.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Scoop's Sam McAlister opens up about the 'real' Amanda Thirsk and relationship after she lost job at palace" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Scoop's Sam McAlister opens up about the 'real' Amanda Thirsk and relationship after she lost job at palace</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e-KfLLF7BcH data-wc=38>"He was brought in for a particular reason, they knew they needed him, but then when he was there, relinquishing some of that control to him might have been tricky to him having done things his own way.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7bd2d20e3c76-screenshot-2024-04-12-at-150006.png><p id=eMismxusnuv data-wc=50>“I think he feels that even if he’d stayed on if it went ahead without his better judgement, I think he feels that he would have been very good at managing the operation afterwards so the fallout wasn’t as horrendous as it was.
