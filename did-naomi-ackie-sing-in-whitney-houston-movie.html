So that’s why the beginning singing in the gospel choirs was me and then you hear this change so that we know it’s Whitney.”</p><p>She also told Yahoo UK, “I sing the first song that you hear in the film when she’s a bit younger and needed to be refined. But most of it is Whitney. I don’t do it too much. 97.9% of it is Whitney!”</p><p>Director Kasi Lemmons also shared that Naomi really does have a great singing voice though! &nbsp;“She was just so good. She sang in the screen test and she sang the same range as Whitney, and I thought, ‘Oh, this allows for some interesting film possibilities.’”</p><p>Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody was released in the United States on December 23, 2022, by Sony Pictures Releasing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyZmXqvrc6moGaZk6C2pnnSoqWgZZmjeri0yK2lnrFdnby2v9OopWaln6u2pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cruise-ship-disappearances.html><span>←</span><span>9 Eerie Cruise Ship Disappearances That Left Authorities Baffled</span></a>
