His net worth, wife, and kids.</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>While many people believe that crocodiles need to be shot, Matt has a different belief system. A professional wrangler, Matt Wright often relocates the Crocs into a safe environment. Over the years, Matt’s work has been the subject of a few TV series including, Outback Wrangler and Monster Croc Wrangler. While Matt is renowned as a wrangler, he doesn’t like people drawing up comparisons between himself and the late Steve Irwin. Matt defines himself based on the work he does and doesn’t like being compared to anyone else. As the man puts it, “Jesus, I’m Matt Wright, I’m going to do my own shit.” It is easy to say the man has garnered immense fame in his line of work however he is getting more news coverage in media and outlets for an entirely different reason as of late in 2023. He has been charged in relation to a fatal helicopter crash that happened in February 2022.&nbsp;The crash killed his friend and co-star Chris Wilson, who was collecting crocodile eggs in a remote area of west Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory.&nbsp;Wright was not on board the helicopter at the time of the crash. In this article, we will take a closer look at everything concerning his biography.</p><p><strong>Matt Wright is an Australian television personality, wildlife expert,&nbsp; and crocodile wrangler who is best known for his work on the National Geography show “Outback Wrangler” and Netflix’s “Wild Croc Territory” reality show. He is an expert in the field of crocodile conservation and management. He has an estimated net worth of USD $3 Million as of 2023.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Matt-Wright.jpg><h2>Early Life:</h2><p>Matt Wright was born on August 29, 1979, on the south coast of South Australia.

Both his parents were interested in the outdoor way of life as a result, Matt was raised in the wilds of Papua New Guinea and the Australian outback. From a young age, he would spend a lot of time in the outdoors and become comfortable around wildlife, including poisonous snakes and deadly spiders.
