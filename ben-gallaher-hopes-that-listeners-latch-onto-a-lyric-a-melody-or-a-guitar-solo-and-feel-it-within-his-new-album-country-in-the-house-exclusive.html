Neil asked me what type of music I listened to growing up, and I responded, ‘it was always country in our house.’ Neil stopped me right there and said, ‘let’s write that.’ The reason we decided to name the album after this track is because, at the end of the day, that is how all of this started for me. If it wasn’t for country music playing in my house growing up, this dream wouldn’t exist.”</span></p><p class=s5><span class=s4><b>CS: Who/what were some of your inspirations when creating this album in particular?</b></span></p><p class=s5><span class=s2><b>BG:</b> “In terms of songwriting, some songs on the record are autobiographical, and some were me putting myself in someone else’s shoes. The songs (such as ‘<a href=#>Quote the Bible</a>’ and ‘<a href=#>Roots Grow Down</a>’) that are personal to me and my life are inspired heavily by my parents and my wife.”</span></p><p class=s5><span class=s4><b>CS: How did you decide which tracks were going to make it onto the album? Did it come naturally or did you have a tough selection process?</b></span></p><p class=s5><span class=s2><b>BG:</b> “We sifted through a couple hundred songs that I’ve written, and, as a team, we chose the ones we felt would best represent me and the type of artist that I am. Performing the songs live and posting teasers on social media have been helpful ways to be able to tell how the fans respond to each song.”</span></p><p class=s5><span class=s4><b>CS: What is your favorite song on the album and why?</b></span></p><p class=s5><span class=s2><b>BG: </b>“That’s a tough one.

The music and lyrics coexist in a way that creates a vulnerable space that will allow listeners to feel deeply, whether they are going through something similar or not.”</span></p><p class=s5><span class=s4><b>CS: What does the process look like when you create a song? Are there any quirks to your method?</b></span></p><p class=s5><span class=s2><b>BG: </b>“Some songs are born from a guitar riff, and some songs are born from a lyrical idea.
