Gonul's cause of death is not yet known.</p><h2>Who was Murat Gonul?</h2><p>Murat Gonul was born on January 6, 1977, in Istanbul, Turkey. Whenever he was on stage, his love for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>bodybuilding</a> was evident. He initially gained notoriety in the IFBB at two professional exhibitions in 2019 while flaunting an amazing v-taper and proportionate physique.</p><p>At the New York Pro, which was widely regarded as the third most prestigious bodybuilding competition after the Arnold Classic and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>Mr. Olympia</a>, Gonul placed 14th in his professional debut. The Niagara Falls Pro saw him finish in eighth position as a result.</p><p>He chose to compete in the 2021 Toronto Pro Supershow and finished sixth. Gonul was known for making consistent progress. A year later, at the Toronto Pro Supershow in 2022, he would give his last performance. He demonstrated his abilities against top competition but ultimately finished behind Hossein Kalateh.</p><h2>Murat Gonul's career</h2><p>Murat Gonul, a native of Istanbul, became passionate about physical fitness at an early age. In Men's 212, he invested the time to establish a top physique. He made his stage debut in 2000 and later won the 70kg class at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>IFBB</a> Turkey World Championship Bodybuilding competition.</p><p>Gonul was introduced to the IFBB Pro League in 2018. He participated in the 2019 New York Pro, following which he made tremendous progress. Gonul had two performances in the previous two years. After placing sixth in the 2021 Toronto Pro Supershow, he was able to place second at the 2022 Toronto Pro Supershow.</p><h2>Murat's cause of death is not yet known</h2><p>Not much information is known about his passing. Gonul's wife was a member of Team Green, whose physique coach Jason Green made the admission that Gonul was on vacation in Costa Rica and had trouble getting back to Canada.</p><p>In the coming days and weeks, a GoFundMe page will be created to help with Gonul's funeral costs and any additional costs his family or loved ones have incurred.</p><h2>Other bodybuilders who died in mysterious circumstances</h2><p>Gonul's passing is the latest illustration of how deadly bodybuilding is. In 2021, a few athletes passed away unexpectedly, shocking the neighborhood. Many believe that George Peterson and former Mr. Olympia Shawn Rhoden's tragic deaths were caused in part by cardiac issues.</p><p>The unsettling pattern persisted in 2022, the year when 44-year-old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>Cedric McMillan</a> passed away. His wife said in a statement that his cause of death is still unknown, despite some speculation that cardiac issues were involved.</p><p>At the age of 46, Jerry Ward, a well-known IFBB/NPC judge and bodybuilder, went away suddenly in his hotel room. Ward's death was attributed to deep vein thrombosis, according to his wife and the coroner.</p><p>Even seven-time Mr. Olympia Arnold Schwarzenegger declared that bodybuilding has become the most hazardous sport in the world given how many athletes have recently tragically perished. According to Arnold, bodybuilders who prioritize size and muscle over other divisions, particularly those in the Men's Open, are putting their lives in jeopardy.</p><p>More from Sportskeeda</p>" modalPopup.closeOnEsc = false; modalPopup.setHeader("Why did you not like this content?"); modalPopup.setContentText(modalText); modalPopup.addCancelOkButton("Submit", resetRatingAndFeedbackForm, sendRating); modalPopup.removeCloseModalIcon(); modalPopup.disableDismissPopup(); modalPopup.open(); } else { sendRating(index); } } function sendRating() { var requestPayload = { "post_id": 1361555, "rating_value": ratingValue } if (ratingValue > 3) { requestPayload.rating_feedback_type = null; requestPayload.rating_feedback = null; } else { if (!$('input[name="drone"]:checked') || !$('input[name="drone"]:checked').value) { showErrorMessage('option'); return; } if (!$(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea") || !$(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea").value) { showErrorMessage('note'); return; } var selectedOption = $('input[name="drone"]:checked').value; var feedbackNote = $(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea").value; requestPayload.rating_feedback_type = selectedOption; requestPayload.rating_feedback = feedbackNote; } pureJSAjaxPost(addratingAPI, requestPayload, onsaveRatingSuccess, onsaveRatingFail, function() {}, true); } function resetRatingAndFeedbackForm() { var activeStars = Array.from($all('.rating span.rating-star.active')); for (var i=0; i &lt; activeStars.length; i++) { activeStars[i].classList.remove("active"); } if ($('input[name="drone"]:checked')) { $('input[name="drone"]:checked').checked = false; } var userNote = document.querySelector(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea"); userNote.value = ''; modalPopup.close(); } function onsaveRatingSuccess() { modalPopup.close(); savePostIdInUserRatedPostsCookie(); $("#post-rating-layout").classList.add("hidden"); $("#post-rating-message").classList.remove("hidden"); window.setInterval(function showMessage() { $("#post-rating-widget").classList.add("hidden"); }, 3000); } function onsaveRatingFail() { console.error('Saving post rating failed!'); modalPopup.close(); } function savePostIdInUserRatedPostsCookie() { userRatedPostIds.push(1361555); var expiryTime = new Date(); expiryTime.setMonth(expiryTime.getMonth() + 12); // Expiry after 1 year setCookie("user_rated_post_ids", JSON.stringify(userRatedPostIds), expiryTime); } function isPostRatedByUser() { var userRatedPostIds = getCookie('user_rated_post_ids'); if (userRatedPostIds) { try { userRatedPostIds = JSON.parse(userRatedPostIds); } catch (err) { console.error(err); return false; } } else { return false; } if(userRatedPostIds.indexOf(1361555) >= 0) { return true; } else { return false; } } function getRatingCountByPostId(postId) { return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { pureJSAjaxGet( getRatingCountBaseURL + postId + '/rating/count', function(data) { try { data = JSON.parse(data); if (data.meta_value) { resolve(data.meta_value); } reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); } catch (err) { reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); } }, function(err) { reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); }, true); }); } function showErrorMessage(messageType) { var messageContainerId = '#' + messageType + '-error'; $(messageContainerId).classList.remove('hidden'); window.setInterval(function () { $(messageContainerId).classList.add("hidden"); }, 5000); } (function() { var callFired = false; function lazyLoadPostRating() { if (callFired) return; callFired = true; if (!isPostRatedByUser()) { getRatingCountByPostId(1361555) .then(function(ratingCount) { if (ratingCount &lt; 10) { $("#post-rating-widget").classList.remove("hidden"); } }) .catch(function(err){ console.error(err); }); } } document.addEventListener("scroll", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); document.addEventListener("mousemove", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); document.addEventListener("touchmove", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); })();<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6uso5WasaJ6wqikaJqfmcajwcilm6Kml2S7psPSZq6hp12iwrOt02aeqKaloXqqssGbZKmqn2KxqrHSZmtv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-alaia-baldwin-husband-who-is-alaia-baldwin-708829-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Alaia Baldwin Husband?
