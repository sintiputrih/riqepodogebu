Dorit replied, “I did not expect that.”</p><p>Crystal hit back, saying, “You should expect it.”</p><p>In her confessional, Crystal took a direct shot at her costar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RHOBH-s-Crystal-Kung-Minkoff-Stands-by-Funny-Dorit-Kemsley-Plastic-Surgery-Comment-341.jpg><p>“Dorit, how would you know what a perfect nipple looks like?” she joked. “You haven’t seen a real body part in 10 years.”</p><p>When addressing the comment with Us, Crystal said she has yet to hear from Dorit about it.</p><p>“I loved it. I think it’s hysterical,” Crystal added. “Dorit’s the one person who’s always saying, ‘Come on Crystal, I know you’re shady. Go for it.’ I don’t think she wanted it at her expense.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RHOBH-s-Crystal-Kung-Minkoff-Stands-by-Funny-Dorit-Kemsley-Plastic-Surgery-Comment-340.jpg><p>Dorit has addressed plastic surgery rumors over the years, shutting down rumors that she had a nose job after former RHOBH star <a href=#><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a> threw shade about her looks.</p><p>In June 2021, Dorit claimed that Lisa, 63, ignored her when they crossed paths during a Los Angeles outing.</p><p>“Ignore her? I just didn’t recognize her lol,” Lisa, 63, wrote in a since-deleted X (formerly Twitter) post, sharing a side-by-side photo of Dorit in high school vs. her present-day look.</p><p>That same month, Dorit attended a barbecue with plastic surgeon Dr. <strong>Ben Talei</strong>, who <a href=#>shared his opinion on the Dorit’s nose</a>. The entire thing was documented, thanks to <a href=#><strong>Teddi Mellencamp</strong></a>, who posted the videos via Instagram Stories at the time.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a> was also in attendance and asked the plastic surgeon to weigh in on the nose job rumors. He said there was “zero f—king chance” Dorit went under the knife.</p><p>“First of all, there’s a vein on top,” he explained. “If that win were ever touched, it would be engorged to hell.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He went on to say that Dorit’s nose is “a little asymmetric, as it’s supposed to be, were it natural.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqrsaOprq15yq6loGWdnrusu8WfZKyskaOxtHnBsmSdp6KewW63xKaqpZ2pYr2trdKtoJxlo6q%2FqLHRsmSdoZdk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bri-chief.html><span>←</span><span>Bri Chief - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
