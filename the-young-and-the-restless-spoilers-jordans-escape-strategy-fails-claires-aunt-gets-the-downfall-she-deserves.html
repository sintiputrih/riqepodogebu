This is the kind of thing that could cause media chaos and launch a massive news story.</p><p>It seems likely Jordan had some sort of escape strategy in place long before she got Claire to bring Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) and the others to the lake house.</p><p>After all, Jordan has had decades to get ready for her revenge! It’d be rather foolish if Jordan didn’t plan a quick getaway for herself once her crimes were committed.</p><p>Maybe Jordan always planned to hide in the house somewhere if things went sideways – at least until the coast was clear.</p><p>In the real world, it seems like the cops would do a more thorough search and stay posted at the crime scene, but the house may be left unattended for soapy reasons.</p><p>Jordan might have a plane or getaway car waiting for her somewhere, but maybe she’ll get intercepted as she tries to flee.</p><p>Although Jordan will hope she can avoid punishment, that doesn’t seem likely since Colleen Zenk, Hayley Erin and Christian LeBlanc (Michael Baldwin) all snapped a photo together on a set that pointed to some jailhouse drama.</p><p>It appears Jordan will be joining Claire in police custody soon, so will Claire betray her aunt again and perhaps tell the cops where to look for her?</p><p>Claire might know where Jordan originally planned to go after the scheme wrapped up, so she could perhaps cut a deal. There might even be some situation where Claire serves as bait to lure Jordan out of hiding and into a trap!</p><p>The Young and the Restless spoilers hint that Jordan’s going down one way or another, so stick with us for updates on her imminent time behind bars.</p><p>CDL’s where you want to be for <a href=# rel=noopener>The Young and the Restless spoilers, updates and news, so make us your top Y&R source.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnpJ2ybsXOrqWgZZGjsW7Ax55kq52jqbmmv9JmqqmnmaGys7%2BMo6arnJGjwG6x0pyYqZ1dqMGzrdOenrJllpa2rb%2BMnKOaoaKawG6t1KerZp%2BVqcBuwMeeZJ2np6OzorjLZqqhnV2ZsrSx0a%2BcrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./secret-celebrity-renovation.html><span>←</span><span>Secret Celebrity Renovation - Watch on Paramount Plus</span></a>
