Monday, June 8, 2015 is the most friendly day of the year — literally, because it marks the celebration of National Best Friend Day. Whether you knew that or not, I'm sure some of you have your best friend nearby, ready to celebrate the day with secret handshakes, inside jokes, and deep, tearful conversations. (Or just wine and Netflix. Do your thang.) But I'm sure there are at least a few of you shmucks out there, like me, whose best friends are far from them today.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A Guide to the Kardashian-Jenner Familys Dogs</h2><time>May 3, 2024</time>

“What are my dogs’ names?” Kylie asked in a “Kylie Quiz” trivia game.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Brent Moss Wife: Was Brent Moss Married?</h2><time>May 3, 2024</time>

Apparently, there’s no such thing as sibling rivalry in the Kardashian-Jenner clan's next generation. Kourtney Kardashian has launched her wide-spanning career through spending time with her sisters on Keeping up with the Kardashians as they traveled the world, documented their adventures, and captured special moments on social media. So perhaps it comes as no surprise that Kardashian’s too-cute, mini-me children are also growing up to be the ultimate BFFs. On Thursday, the 37-year-old mother of three took to Instagram to offer a glimpse at her recent time off, which included a visit to the Bahamas, and posted an image of Penelope Disick, who just turned 4-years-old, and Mason Disick, 6, walking along a pebble-stone covered path.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>NVIDIA Releases 381.89 WHQL Driver</h2><time>May 3, 2024</time>

Startup company Lumina, maker of its 4K AI-based webcam, has announced a new programmable-height computer desk that also has a built-in screen and its own operating system, Lumina OS. While an embedded display might sound a bit silly, Lumina thinks it could actually have an impact on productivity.
Sit-stand desks have been around for a while now, and push-button raising and lowering is nothing new. Where Lumina has innovated is by making the height adjustment programmable.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Is Candy Montgomery? - The True Story behind the New Series Candy Starring Jessica Biel</h2><time>May 3, 2024</time>
