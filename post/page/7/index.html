[Jeezy: talking]
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
All's well that ends well
Outside watering their lawn and shit
Birds are chirping, dogs are barking
It's beautiful
That may be your hood but this is my hood...[Verse 1:]
Got the red dogs trippin' and these niggaz still snitchin
The old lady across the street still bitchin
It's 3 in the mornin take your old ass to sleep
The third time she's called the police this week</article><article class=post-entry><h2>4,000-Year-Old Burial Chamber Discovered In Devon, England</h2><time>Sep 29, 2024</time>
