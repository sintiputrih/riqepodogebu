橋浦麻美子さんという女性は、過去にスピッツの草野マサムネさんを長期的にストーカーしていたことで有名な女性です。
彼女の草野さんへのストーカー行為は、長年ネット界隈で有名でありました。
昨今、芸能人の方がストーカー被害に遭うなどの報道があると、決まって過去に草野さんが過去に彼女に受けていたストーキング行為が再注目されます。
今日は橋浦麻美子さんが草野マサムネさんにしてきたストーカー行為や、その後のことをまとめてみたいと思います。
橋浦麻美子はどんな女性？出身地と年齢・生年月日。京都造形芸術大学を卒業後にカメラの専門？ 本名：橋浦麻美子（はしうら まみこ）
生年月日：1975年5月3日
出身地：宮城県
血液型：AB型
橋浦さんが2ちゃんに書き込んでた期間は長期的で、自身のことについて書くことも多くありました。
本名から生年月日まで明らかになっているとは、なかなかすごいことですね・・・。
自分の個人情報を公開してたり、免許書をネットにアップするなどしていました。
橋浦麻美子さんは宮城県出身で、大学は京都造形芸術大学を卒業。
大学を出て上京した後に、東京のカメラの専門学校でカメラの勉強をしていたそうです。
顔が美人な橋浦麻美子のファンクラブが存在した？ 橋浦麻美子さんは匿名掲示板のスピッツのスレで目立っていただけでなく、ライブ会場でも目立っていたそうです。
実は橋浦さんは”それなりの美人”であり、なぜミュージシャンのストーカーをしてるのか謎だと言われていました。
そんな橋浦麻美子さんにファンクラブが存在していた時期があったそうです。
スピッツのライブに通う男性ファンが中心になって作られたファンクラブだったそうです。
ライブで彼女を見た男性が、”確かに一目惚れするほどに美人”と納得するほど見た目が魅力的だったということですね。
ただ、スピッツの女性ファンからすると、圧倒的に不愉快だったことでしょう・・・笑。
橋浦麻美子が草野マサムネに行ったストーカー行為。自宅訪問やプレゼントやメッセージ・写真の送り付け 橋浦麻美子さんが草野マサムネさんに対しストーカー行為を行うようになったのは、2001年のスピッツのライブがきっかけでした。
２００１年にスピッツのライブに訪れた橋浦麻美子さんは、ステージ上の草野マサムネがずっと自分の方を見つめ、「草野さんが自分に対して手を振ってくれた」、「草野さんが自分のことを見つめている」など草野さんが自身に一目惚れしたと思い込み、そこから草野マサムネへの異常な執着が始まるように。
橋浦麻美子さんはスピッツのファンクラブに入会し、それから草野さんに対してストーカー行為をするようになっていきました。
橋浦麻美子のストーカー行為は11年間も続き、2011年に報じられたことで世間にも広く知られるようになりました。
橋浦麻美子さんは自身のブログを開設。
大型掲示板・２チャンネルを中心に自分が草野マサムネの彼女であると発言。
ネット上では草野マサムネが自分に会いに来たという妄想話を掲載し、会った場所や会話の内容なども事細かに書き込みました。
「彼と結婚する予定がある」「自分の個人情報を盗み出して自宅に会いに来た」等、相思相愛であるかのような内容を繰り返し書き込んでいました。
橋浦麻美子は草野の住所を突き止めるとストーカーがエスカレート その後、草野マサムネの自宅を突き止め、ポストを漁って郵便物を盗み見たり、インターホンを押し続けて会おうとしたりと、その行動はどんどんエスカレートしていきました。
草野さん宅の郵便受けを漁り周辺住民に草野さんについての情報を聞いて回るなど迷惑行為を繰り返していました。
極め付けは、尋常ではない数のプレゼントや自身の顔写真を送りつける行為です。
プレゼントは最初こそはマフラーなど可愛い物でしたが、次第にエスカレートしていき手作りの料理や使用済みの生理用品までも送り付けていたそうです。
橋浦麻美子はファンクラブを強制退会。事務所から警告文 長年、草野マサムネさんに対してストーカー行為を続けていた橋浦麻美子さん。
しかし、遂にはファンクラブを強制的に退会させられてしまいました。
なんと橋浦麻美子はファンクラブのメッセージ機能を使用し、そこから卑猥な画像を送り付けていたのです。
これにはスピッツの所属事務所も堪らず彼女に警告文を送りました。時期にして２００７年です。
が、橋浦さんはこの警告を無視。
警告文を受け取ったあと、反省するわけでもなくこの警告文をネットに投稿。
その後もストーカー行為を続け、結果ファンクラブを強制退会される事態となりました。
その後に２ちゃんねる上に自分の顔写真と共もメッセージを送っていました。
この内容を読んでる限り、自分が彼の彼女ではないことは理解してるような気がするのですが・・・。
また、彼女は自分のブログなどに自分の体の写真や、卑猥なことをしてる動画を出していたそうです。
草野マサムネが体調不良でライブ中止になったことも 橋浦麻美子さんのストーカー行為がシャレにならない出来事がありました。
それはスピッツの2011年のライブツアーの時期です。
この２０１１年のライブは草野マサムネさんの体調不良により延期となりました。
中止の理由は体調不良で、その原因は東日本大震災により過度のストレスを感じたからだと言われていました。
スピッツの公式ホームページでの病名は急性気管支炎と急性咽頭喉頭炎と発表されています。
ファンの間では、体調不良の理由はそれだけではなく、実は橋浦麻美子のストーカー被害にあっていたことも理由のひとつだと言われていました。
せっかく楽しみにしていたライブが中止になったということで、当時のファンの橋浦さんへの怒りは凄まじかったです。
草野マサムネと勘違いしたメル友と結婚を断られ１億円の慰謝料を請求。出会い系のサクラに騙された疑惑も 昔、橋浦麻美子には当時メル友がいたそうです。
橋浦さんはメル友を草野マサムネさんだと思い込んでおり、結婚の約束までしていたそうです。
一部では出会い系のサクラに草野さんになりすましてる人がいて、橋浦さんはそのなりすましのサクラに騙されていただけではないか？との説もあります。
橋浦さんが草野さんの個人情報を突き止めたきっかけも、そのメル友に住所と電話番号をたずねましたが教えて貰えなかったため、興信所を使ったのが始まりだとされてます。
橋浦さんはメル友に「子供が欲しい」と伝えましたが、結婚を断られ、これを「婚約破棄」だとして、警察に相談したり1億円もの慰謝料を請求したといわれています。
橋浦麻美子の現在の仕事。京都内でチャットレディやスタジオ会社に勤務しているとの噂 ファンクラブから締め出され、その後に結婚にも失敗した橋浦麻美子さん。
現在は匿名掲示板からも姿を消して、近況は不明です。
ただ、一時期、チャットレディに彼女にそっくりな人がいるとの目撃がありました。
また、カメラの専門学校を卒業してるとのことで、フォトスタジオに勤務してるのではないか？という説もあります。
一時期は精神的な病気を患っているということで、国からのお金で生活してるとの説もありました。</description></item><item><title>Camp Airy Maryland fire today: About 100 firefighters from area battle massive blaze</title><link>/camp-airy-maryland-fire-today-about-100-firefighters-from-area-battle-massive-blaze.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/camp-airy-maryland-fire-today-about-100-firefighters-from-area-battle-massive-blaze.html</guid><description>THURMONT, Md. — Crews battled a fire at an overnight summer camp in western Maryland on Wednesday morning, but no injuries were reported, officials said.

And I'll show you a world that you can understand.
This life is filled with hurt,
When happiness doesn't work.
Trust me and take my hand,
When the lights go out you will understand.</description></item><item><title>Buccaneers' 2023 draft pick Cody Mauch comes with toothless signature look</title><link>/buccaneers-2023-draft-pick-cody-mauch-comes-with-toothless-signature-look.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/buccaneers-2023-draft-pick-cody-mauch-comes-with-toothless-signature-look.html</guid><description>Explore More The Buccaneers got a character with tackle Cody Mauch from North Dakota.
