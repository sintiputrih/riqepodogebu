The only difference was that he was able to maintain his power and thus didn’t need anyone to succeed him to keep the Sith lineage alive. When, in one of the Sequels, he said “I am all of the Sith” I understood it as “I am everything a Sith could ever become” – kind of like “I am the Senate”.</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=90 data-injectable=false>It’s also pointed out that Sidious can effectively decide what the Sith ideology is:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>NerdHistorian’s comment from discussion "Darth Sidious is referred by many as one of, if not the most powerful Sith Lord to have lived.
