id=block-d421b8c0-dd96-45c4-be32-a809187e0518>The champ was compared to the WWE legend during his first fight with Wilder when he looked to have been knocked out cold but got up to&nbsp;<a

Fury labelled the Bronze Bomber and Breland’s replacement, Malik Scott, “a pack of losers”.</p><p id=block-a55a66fe-fa79-4def-a44c-0452842554d5>However Wilder claims he has calmed down since the last fight and is confident of victory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TYSON-FURY-infographic-1.jpg></li></ul><ul><li id=liveblog-entry-16373917 data-timestamp=1633799407><p>FIGHTER COMPARISON</p><p>It’s pretty fair to say that Fury and Wilder are two completely different fighters.</p><p>In years gone by, Wilder has been known for his one-punch knockout power, his ferocious finishes and the mighty torque he gets into his right hands.</p><p>He’s often been criticised for his lack of traditional boxing technique, having picked up the sport late in his life, before managing to secure himself an Olympic bronze medal at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.</p><p>But Wilder has rarely ever needed boxing technique to get through his fights, boasting an incredible 41 knockouts from his 44 fights.</p><p>Fury, on the other hand, has been boxing since he was a child, and is known for his excellent footwork, feinting, double-jabbing and ring IQ.</p><p>He outwitted the great Wladimir Klitschko in their world title clash back in 2015 and outboxed Wilder for long periods of their first fight in 2018, though it ended in a draw.</p><p>Fury does pack a heavy punch, however, as he showed in his rematch with Wilder, but it’s his boxing which allows him to set up the offensive side of his game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/VP-GRAPHIC-SPORT-FURY-V-WILDER.jpg></li><li id=liveblog-entry-16373906 data-timestamp=1633798402><p>WHO IS TRAINING WILDER?</p><p>Wilder has brought in a new head trainer in Malik Scott, who the Bronze Bomber fought and knocked out back in 2014.</p><p>Scott and Wilder have worked all summer in attempt to sharpen the latter’s boxing skills, quickening both his feet and hands in preparation for Fury.</p><p>Wilder will still have ex-head trainer Jay Deas in his corner, but Scott will take charge on fight night.</p><p>The Alabama native used to have former world champion Mark Breland in his corner, but he was sacked after Wilder accused him of spiking his water before the second Fury fight.</p><p>It was also Breland who threw the towel in, forcing the referee to stop the fight midway through the seventh round.</p></li><li id=liveblog-entry-16373806 data-timestamp=1633797158><p>FURY VS WILDER 1 – WHAT HAPPENED?</p><p>Fury’s first fight with Wilder took place in Los Angeles, California on December 1, 2018, several months after the Gypsy King’s two comeback bouts with Sefer Seferi and Francesco Pianeta.</p><p>Wilder was the favourite heading into the fight, having knocked out every opponent he’d ever faced before Fury, who had spent two years out of the ring with drug addiction and mental health problems.</p><p>But the fight ended in a controversial split decision draw after both fighters enjoyed success throughout the contest.</p><p>Fury managed to outbox Wilder for most of the fight but was knocked down in the ninth and 12th rounds.</p><p>The fight was scored 115-111 for Wilder, 114-112 for Fury and 113-113.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fury-light.png></li><li id=liveblog-entry-16373702 data-timestamp=1633796146><p>WHO IS TRAINING FURY?</p><p>Tyson Fury will be trained, once again, by SugarHill Steward, who took his corner for the second Wilder fight.</p><p>Fury used to be trained by Ben Davison, who was in charge for the very first Wilder bout, but was replaced by Steward a year later.</p><p>Steward instantly implemented his ‘Kronk style’ of training, one in which where boxers who fight out of the Kronk Gym in Detroit, Michigan, seek to put pressure on their opponents to force a knockout.</p><p>The style of fighting was first introduced by legendary trainer Emanuel Steward, SugarHill’s late uncle.</p><p>Fury predicted that with SugarHill in his corner, he would bring the fight to Wilder and take him out during their second fight, a prediction not many believed in.</p></li><li id=liveblog-entry-16373609 data-timestamp=1633795213><p>VENUE</p><p>Fury vs Wilder 3 will take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, making it the third different venue in pair’s three fights.</p><p>Fury vs Wilder 1 took place at Staples Center in Los Angeles back in December 2018.</p><p>And while their second happened in Las Vegas, the MGM Grand Garden Arena was the venue.</p><p>But now the T-Mobile Arena, which has hosted huge fights such as Floyd Mayweather vs Conor McGregor, Canelo Alvarez vs Gennady Golovkin and numerous big UFC events, will play host for their third clash.</p></li><li id=liveblog-entry-16373510 data-timestamp=1633794350><p>ODDS</p><p>Unbeaten Fury goes into the fight as the favourite with

id=liveblog-entry-16373355 data-timestamp=1633792852><p>FURY VS WILDER 2 – WHAT HAPPENED?</p><p>Fury vs Wilder 2 took place in Las Vegas on February 20, 2020 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.</p><p>The second fight turned out to be a more one-sided affair, with Fury shocking the boxing world to stop Wilder in the seventh round of their Las Vegas clash.</p><p>Fury came into the fight with a new trainer in SugarHill Steward, after utilising Ben Davison in his corner for the first bout.</p><p>Steward and Fury adopted an offensive game plan and came forward at Wilder throughout the fight, knocking him down in rounds three and five.</p><p>Wilder’s assistant trainer Mark Breland eventually threw in the towel at the midway point of the seventh round, making Fury the WBC and Ring Magazine heavyweight champion.</p><p>But this weekend, Wilder will finally get his chance at vengeance.</p></li><li id=liveblog-entry-16373110 data-timestamp=1633791164><p>WILDIN’ OUT</p><p>Deontay Wilder says

his weight comes in, I can lay on my back and lift him.</p><p>“It won’t be none of that rushing me and putting all his weight on me, and different things like that. But most of all, we just want to have fun.</p><p>Calmness is the key to the storm.</p><p>“I know that when I’m not calm, my mind is cloudy, so when your mind is cloudy it allows you to make bad decisions.”</p></li><li id=liveblog-entry-16372990 data-timestamp=1633790044><p>FIGHTING TALK</p><p>Tyson Fury believes that Deontay Wilder knows deep in his soul he will lose tonight in Las Vegas.</p><p>“Deep down in his soul, he knows he lost and he’ll lose again,” said Fury.</p><p>“After this fight, he’ll be back working in that fast food chain that he was working at earlier on in his career. It’s retirement for him.</p><p>“You’re in denial and you’re getting knocked out. Do yourself a favour and retire – your legacy’s in bits, all the excuses, you’ve been destroyed.
