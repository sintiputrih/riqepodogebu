Unfortunately, much like in her past dating experiences, the mother of three fell victim to alleged cheating, causing her to walk away from the BMF actor. He's been busy <a href=# rel>looking for a replacement</a> lover in time for cuffing season (apparently to little luck) while Walker has been hinting at using her heartbreak to inspire her next few trips to the studio. Elsewhere, the Still Over It singer has been <a href=# rel>raising eyebrows</a> with her social media posts about figures like Meech and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Chrisean Rock</a>.</p><p>The R&B starlet is facing backlash for <a href=# rel>appearing to poke fun</a> at the Baltimore native's Walmart baby carrier incident. Only a few days into motherhood at the time, Rock failed to use her holder to properly support Junior's delicate neck while out at the grocery store, subsequently going viral after a stranger posted a video of the troubling moment. At the time, Walker publicly supported Rock, so her diss was confusing for the 23-year-old. However, the Atlanta-born artist didn't seem too apologetic when Chrisean called her out, instead going on to poke fun at Meech in another post on her profile.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Chrisean Rock’s Feelings Were Hurt By Summer Walker Video, She Admits</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-meech-falls-victim-to-summer-walker-s-trolling>Lil Meech Falls Victim to Summer Walker's Trolling</h2></span><p>As HipHopDX reports, Walker posted a photo of Meech in a black and pink outfit on her Story earlier this week. Simply showing off her ex with no context would be strange, but the black-haired beauty added her signature humorous touch to the situation by adding vocals of her singing "Danger (Been So Long)" by <a href=# class=text-word rel>Mystikal</a> in the background. Now that blogs are reporting that the pair might have stepped out for a dinner together, we think the Southern star's post might've been a hint at reconciliation with her ex.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Summer Walker Talks About Dissing Someone’s Mama In The Studio Again After Lil Meech Split</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Exes Seemingly Enjoy Dinner Date Together</h2></span><p>What are your thoughts on Summer Walker potentially spinning the block with Lil Meech after putting him on blast for his infidelity?
