While that may hold somewhat true, some of the former lovers of her past partners are likely to tell you otherwise. Obviously, her new beau, Ethan Slater's estranged wife, Lilly Jay, is the number one name on the list as the Wicked star navigates his divorce. The internet has come together behind the mother of one amid the drama. Critics are notably bashing Grande for knowingly getting romantic with a married man.</p><p>It seems history is repeating itself, as the late Glee actress Naya Rivera also previously called out the "pete davidson" singer for spending time with <a href=# rel>her man</a> at the time, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Big Sean</a>.

The most recent update on her situation with Slater reveals that she's keeping her distance until his divorce legalities are resolved. At this time, she's also <a href=# rel>navigating a separation</a> from her husband, Dalton Gomez.</p><p>As you may recall, one of Big Sean's most well-known tracks, "IDFWU," was actually written about Naya Rivera.
