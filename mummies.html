Those who couldn’t afford the tax had to stand by and watch as their loved ones were pulled out of the ground and moved into the crypts.</p><p>It was then that the crypt owners found the mummified bodies in the crypts, their faces forever frozen in expressions that look like screams.</p><p>And as the crypt owners took a closer look at the <a href=# rel=noopener>“Guanajuato Mummies,”</a> they soon made several more horrifying discoveries.</p><p>One body, that of Ignacia Aguilar, had been found biting into her own arm.

Her 24-week-old fetus had also been mummified — one of the youngest mummies in existence.</p><p>The mummies became so well known that 111 were put on display by the early 1900s. And 59 are still on display today at El Museo de las Momias.</p><p>But despite the years passing, the horror of the mummies’ faces hasn’t faded. In 1947, nearly a century after the cholera epidemic, author Ray Bradbury visited a crypt in Guanajuato and could barely stomach the sight.</p><p>“The experience so wounded and terrified me, I could hardly wait to flee Mexico,” he said. “I had nightmares about dying and having to remain in the halls of the dead with those propped and wired bodies.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyuwcymoJ6rX2o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heartbreaking-tv-show-deaths-that-we-will-never-get-over.html><span>←</span><span>25 most shocking and heartbreaking TV show deaths that we'll never get over</span></a>
