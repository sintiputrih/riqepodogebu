Officials say a confrontation between students escalated rapidly, resulting in both injuries and a massive law enforcement response.</span></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Disturbing_Physical_Altercation_in_Front_of_Peers></span><span><strong><span>Disturbing Physical Altercation in Front of Peers</span></strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span><span>Eighth grader Jaiden Mojica was among the crowd of students who shockingly witnessed the violent clash firsthand. He recalled seeing one victim walking while clutching their side afterwards.</span></span></p><p><span><span>“I saw a student walking like this (holding side), I assume that’s the one that got stabbed,” described Mojica. “I came back from breakfast over to the eighth-grade wing where I saw a big crowd. The fight had just finished and then the kid was walking from there this way. So I assume he was going to the nurse.”</span></span></p><p><span><span>While specifics remain under investigation, officials have indicated a “student-on-student” incident involving some type of stab or puncture wounds. Both injured pupils were quickly transported to receive emergency medical care.</span></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Entire_Middle_School_Placed_Under_Lockdown></span><span><strong><span><span>Entire Middle School Placed Under Lockdown </span></span></strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span><span><span>In response to an undoubtedly terrifying situation for the school community, authorities immediately secured the entire Monhagen campus.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>As per strict lockdown protocols, all external building doors were secured against potential outside threats while police canvassed school grounds. Officials confirmed no intruder entered facilities, deeming it an isolated clash.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Superintendent Amy Creeden acknowledged the traumatic impact this incident has inflicted on vulnerable young minds. “What happened today is not OK,” she affirmed. “It is very concerning, it is upsetting, My heart hurts.”</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Counseling resources stand at the ready to support families, students and staff struggling to process events.</span></span></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Investigation_Ongoing_as_Suspects_Undergo_Police_Custody></span><span><strong><span><span>Investigation Ongoing as Suspects Undergo Police Custody</span></span></strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span><strong><span><span></span></span></strong></span></h2><p><span><span><span>Middletown law enforcement officials remain actively investigating circumstances leading up to the altercation.
