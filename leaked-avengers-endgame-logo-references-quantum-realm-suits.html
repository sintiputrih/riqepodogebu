Still, much of the internet is already assuming as such – hence the armor’s unofficial name – and at the very least, it’s clear that this mysterious place will be <a href=# rel=noopener>of great significance</a> in the <a href=# rel=noopener>Avengers: Infinity War</a> sequel.</p><p data-characters=601 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=false>Regardless, these suits are just one of several revelations that the recent stream of leaks has brought us. In&nbsp;the various unofficial material that dropped over the weekend, we can also find early glimpses at the costumes worn by Pepper Potts and Clint Barton in their respective new personas of <a href=# rel=noopener>Rescue</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Ronin</a>. Better yet, one action figure leak has seemingly confirmed the comeback of <a href=# rel=noopener>an old fan favorite</a> from one of Thor’s previous adventures. We’ll see who else is returning to the fray, and what they’ll be wearing along the way, when <strong>Avengers: Endgame</strong> hits theaters on April 26th, 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo56Zm5qxbq3VnqWgnaKoeqa6w6CYpp1dobyou4yrnJ%2Bdopq7pLHSZqiumZ6pwq550Z6YpaVdqMKqwNJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./older-celebrity-dads-having-babies-late-in-life.html><span>←</span><span>Meet the Celebrity OAPs (Old Age Papas): Al Pacino, Robert De Niro &amp;amp; more</span></a>
