Bonnie, son George H. (Bud) Dunham and Trish J. Brown, daughter Laurie Dunham Maul and Thomas M. Maul, all of East Sandwich, Mass., and three loving grandkids, Clayton T. Maul of New York City, Katherine M. Dunham of Providence, R.I., and Caroline D. Maul of Austin, TX.</p><p>Jim, born August 7, 1942, to George H. (Bud) Dunham and Mary Van Alstyne Dunham, was raised at Sunnyside Farm in Kinderhook after his father died in WWII. How a child without a father could be so special is a recurring question. He and his mother were reared by six cousins and seven maternal and fraternal aunts and uncles. Jim was also close to his mother and father-in-law, Bill and Ruth Becker of Valatie, N.Y., four brothers and sisters-in-law, and fourteen nieces and nephews.</p><p>Family was his priority. Kinderhook, his church, baseball, chocolate, and country music were close seconds. After 50 years, Jim was Mayor and Village Trustee for numerous terms. He was humbled and proud when Dunham Park in the Village Square was named after him this summer. Longtime Kinderhook Reformed Church consistory and cemetery committee member. His 30-year volunteer firefighting and minor league coaching showed his generosity. Jim adored Kinderhook Robins and Cleveland baseball. He adored Adirondack and Cape Cod family vacations and old-time country music.</p><p>Jim worked for NYSDOT for 35 years after getting his B.S. in Civil Engineering from WPI and Professional Engineer license. Every action Jim took was humble, real, decent, and kind. He was a good son, husband, father, grandfather, civic leader, and person. The Raymond E. Bond Funeral Home in Valatie will hold a wake on Thursday, December 21, from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. Kinderhook Reformed Church will hold a memorial service and burial in Kinderhook Cemetery on Friday, December 22 at 11:00 a.m.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmanBrbHHqKysnV6asbZ61admo5mdmsBusNSnn5qlXaSvqsDUmqmyZZ6WwarCxGamn2WbnrulsdGhpqijXaN6unnHmqpmrKKWtKqvwKWjsmWglsC0scNmmLCZqWLBs7XBrqueq12Wu6V5zJ6kqKqZlrluwMeeZLCnoqGxbrvBoqusZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./intel-to-support-128gb-of-ddr4-on-core-9th-gen-desktop-processors.html><span>←</span><span>Intel to Support 128GB of DDR4 on Core 9th Gen Desktop Processors</span></a>
