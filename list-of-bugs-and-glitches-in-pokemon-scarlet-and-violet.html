Over 10 million copies were sold during the first three days, but players began asking for refunds due to the game’s poor performance.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Since the game first launched, trainers noticed multiple performance issues that rendered the game unplayable. Some of them are minor things, like rendering issues and Pokémon drowning. Others, like lag, just ruin the experience while playing the game. It’s as if Game Freak is unable to produce a high-quality game, which is unfortunate since the game had multiple QA testers employed in different regions to see if the game was up to scratch.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>Before you consider getting yourself a copy of the ninth generation Pokémon game, here are all the glitches and bugs found by players in&nbsp;Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lag-and-low-frame-rates data-injectable=false>Lag and low frame rates</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>oof the reviews arent kidding about the terrible performance <a href=#>#PokemonScarletViolet</a> <a href=#>#NintendoSwitch</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0oDvYQmMqV</a></p>— cherrim @ pkmn scarlet (@Cherrim) <a href=#>November 17, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Let’s start easy and mention how this game runs very poorly on the Switch. Trainers have experienced lag and low frame rates when playing this game and certain animations run very slowly. It gets worse for some trainers when they’re exploring lakes and oceans and their games suddenly slow down due to different animations and activities happening onscreen.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>What’s worse is how the lag distorts your recorded gameplay hours. TikTok user @smallant&nbsp;shared a video&nbsp;where his recorded time was less than the number of hours he played due to low frame rates, which is very unfortunate. It also got worse during multiplayer terra-raid battles, where trainers sometimes can’t make moves due to lag and connection issues.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@smallant href=#>@smallant</a><p>9% of the game is lag <a title=smallant href=#>#SmallAnt</a> <a title=pokemon href=#>#Pokemon</a> <a title=twitch href=#>#Twitch</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - SmallAnt" href=#>♬ original sound – SmallAnt</a></figure><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Surely when you have a new game, you should be able to run it smoothly.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-clipping-and-disappearing-assets data-injectable=false>Clipping and disappearing assets</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Im so done with this game <a href=#>#PokemonViolet</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/06LH6NdTgt</a></p>— Erielle Sudario (@ErielleSudario) <a href=#>November 19, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>Another common issue found in the game is the clipping or disappearing assets. Whether that may be your Pokémon fused with the environment or the ground suddenly disappearing, these things commonly occurred in the game, which helps ruin the immersion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Odd lighting/rendering</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Gimmighoul saw the lighting glitch coming and noped out <a href=#>#PokemonScarletViolet</a> <a href=#>#PokemonScarlet</a> <a href=#>#PokemonViolet</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lsHpRItPib</a></p>— Pokemon Scarlet/Violet Bugs (@PokemonBugs) <a href=#>November 21, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet also proved that it can’t render its own game properly. Trainers have noticed major rendering issues, especially when it comes to lighting and how it would oddly appear and disappear. This is not good, especially if you’re playing an open-world RPG game.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Pokèmon won’t evolve</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>The only glitch I've run into is auto-battling preventing my pokemon from evolving. :T really frustrating.

However, some trainers reported that nothing happened after meeting the requirements and had to ask their friends to help. While this glitch was rare, it is disappointing to see all that effort wasted, especially if you’re trying to complete the Pokédex.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Stretched-out trainers/Pokémon</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>SPOILER New secret boss found <a href=#>#PokemonScarletandviolet</a> <a href=#>#PokemonScarletViolet</a> <a href=#>#svleaks</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/M1EqFaD3B8</a></p>— … (@ferraris26) <a href=#>November 20, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>Imagine playing through the game only to see this weird and scary monstrosity appear in the wild. Maybe you’re playing with your friends, only to see one of them stretched out of proportion. While these moments make the gameplay experience quite funny, it’s not a good look, especially for a company that sold more than $12 million worth of units in its previous release. If Game Free is struggling with its 3D models, perhaps it should just stick with 2D.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Odd teleportation to cut scenes</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is my new favorite glitch for Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet.<br>What a wonderfully well tested game.<br>I understand, small indie company can't afford to test everything intensively. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WgjbLWf5hi</a></p>— Dupletor (@Dupletor) <a href=#>November 19, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>Another issue some trainers found is that the game would instantly send them to the cut scene, even if they’re not where they should be to trigger the event. Even if you’re above the required area, you still get teleported to the cut scene. While the game has an interesting story, it’s not worth exploring if trainers are being forced to partake in it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-invisible-bike data-injectable=false>“Invisible bike”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Crazy Pokemon <a href=#>#PokemonEcarlateViolet</a> <a href=#>#PokemonScarletViolet</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/eNXQ7LhPPi</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/sCNz87zRXl</a></p>— Crous hate account.

For some reason, trainers noticed Miridon or Koridon disappearing when in ride mode. Meanwhile, the trainer can still travel around like nothing’s happened. This glitch was first discovered by a Japanese trainer, which prompted English users to put the iconic Crazy Frog song in the video.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drowned-pokemon data-injectable=false>“Drowned pokemon”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>BEWARE NEW POKÉMON SPOILERS</p><p>Holy shit the Makuhita are drowning themselves this game rules<a href=#>#PokemonScarletViolet</a> <a href=#>#NintendoSwitch</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/t3uj9VwsDU</a></p>— Aleksei Birthday in 2 Days! (@AlekseiTheBun) <a href=#>November 18, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;should be praised for its physics. From the sandwich-making game to Pokémon drowning in the water, it makes the world feel more accurate. However, while it made sense for the food mini-game, Pokémon should not drown. Usually, a floatable platform should appear if a Pokémon can’t swim while in battle. I guess some Pokémon aren’t that lucky, especially during the early game.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Duplication Glitch</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=792 data-injectable=true>Just like in previous Pokémon games, the duplication glitch has returned. YouTuber SideArms4Reason found a glitch that allowed him to collect as many shiny Pokémon as possible to the point it breaks all the odds. Others found an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">item duplication glitch</a>&nbsp;where they were able to get multiple master balls or any item a trainer wants. The last time we had a glitch this bad was during the Gameboy era. It was easy to duplicate your items back then, and you can do the same right now.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>The “RNG seed” in competitive play</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Uh oh.</p><p>Pokémon Scarlet/Violet Battle Stadium currently is using the same RNG seed for every battle.</p><p>This allows us to choose moves to ensure that OHKO moves such as Sheer Cold always hit! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lSlBJr1AF6</a></p>— Anubis (@Sibuna_Switch) <a href=#>November 27, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>This one is bad for those who play competitive Pokémon. Trainers noticed that&nbsp;Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;use the same RNG seed, making every battle predictable. Reddit user&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">u/Lord-Trolldemort</a>&nbsp;shared a detailed post about the glitch. Essentially, it comes down to the chances a move hits the opponent. This user noticed that sheer cold, a move with a high accuracy rate, misses all the time and proved that the game uses the same seed. Other competitors began investigating this, and it was the same results.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>While this is nothing for casual players, this is bad for competitive play. It just means that people can predict which moves go first and can build their teams accordingly. It’s like shuffling a deck of cards, but the same sequence of numbers comes out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Game Crashes</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>LMAOOO!!! I love Shofu's reaction.<br>Pokémon driving crashes your game. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/17YwGXMOiM</a></p>— Fizzwin (@FizzwinCH) <a href=#>November 18, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Lastly, the game crashes. To the poor souls who don’t have auto-save on just in case they’d shiny hunt, just having the game crash in the middle of your session is the worst. While there is a way to recover a backup save file, the feeling of losing hours of gameplay due to hardware and software issues will hurt a lot. I guess that’s why Game Freak added the “autosave” feature as an optional setting.</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is a good game. It has an amazing story and the open-world feature makes this game feel less linear. The performance issues this game has makes it unbearable and break the immersion. For a company that earns millions of dollars for each title it releases, it’s depressing to see how the developers are unable to produce something that’s playable. But hey, at least some of them ended up becoming meme content.</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false>If you think you could bare the issues this game has, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is now available on the Nintendo Switch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoo6KrpGK8p3nBrp6sZZGjsW6zy6KrnKCVqHqquoyppqSdnaS7br%2FCmqmlnaRirq%2BwjK%2BgqKSVqXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./janice-villagran.html><span>←</span><span>Janice Villagran - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Facts</span></a>
