She also revealed her on-trend platform Gucci slides as she stepped forward, featuring the brands signature beige GG monogram in various sizes. The New York native added a butterfly pair of sunglasses with a rhinestone detail, and held onto a beige sweater and floral print fan to stay cool. Meanwhile, Bryan — who is one of her back-up dancers — was spotted behind her in a blue t-shirt, black shirts and a pair of leather slip-on sneakers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nick-Cannon-Monroe-Dancing-Mariah-Song-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Nick confirmed via Instagram that he’s going to be a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>father for the 10th time</a> on Wednesday, Aug. 24. “Time Stopped and This Happened…” he captioned a photo from what appears to be a maternity photoshoot, with Brittany showing off her growing bump. The pair are also parents to son <strong>Golden</strong>, 5, and daughter <strong>Powerful Queen</strong>, 1. Nick is also imminently expecting his ninth baby with <strong>Abby De La Rosa</strong> in the coming weeks, who he has twins <strong>Zion Mixolydian</strong> and <strong>Zillion Heir</strong>, 1, with. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dad-of-eight</a> has had his hands full with a newborn, too, as partner <strong>Brie Tiesi</strong> just have birth a month ago to their baby boy. Sadly, Nick’s son with <strong>Alyssa Scott</strong>, Zen, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>passed away</a> at just five months old in Dec. 2021 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Mariah has not commented on news that Nick is expecting more children, particularly a 10th baby, but Nick has been clear that his desire for many kids is intentional. “I’m having these kids on purpose. I don’t have no accident!” he said on Power 106 Los Angeles in July. “Trust me, there’s a lot of people I could’ve gotten pregnant that I didn’t. The ones that got pregnant are the ones that were supposed to get pregnant. … You only live once,” he also said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Nick and Mariah married after a whirlwind romance in the Bahamas in 2008, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed their only kids</a> — and Nick’s first — in April 2011. The pair split in 2014, and finalized their divorce in 2016. The actor and comedian has open in the past that he “messed up” with his “dream girl” Mariah, and admitted she “ain’t coming back” now that he has so many more kids. When speaking about the song “Alone” on his talk show in Feb. 2022, he explained: “The song wasn’t really about trying to get her back. It was taking ownership of what I did as a man and owning my flaws and expressing it through song.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FxZqaZop6uqXnCmqmesV2btrO%2F02anoaekpMBuusicomabkaO7sLqMametoF2XrqPFjJqlp6elo7CmucSnq2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erin-stiegemeier.html><span>←</span><span>Erin Stiegemeier</span></a>
