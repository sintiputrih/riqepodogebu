<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>'UnREAL' Finale: Rachel's Ex Does the Unthinkable in Stunning Twist</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>How deep does the rabbit hole go? <i>UnREAL</i>‘s season finale on Monday, August 8, dove into its darkest territory yet, as Rachel Goldberg (<b><a href=#>Shiri Appleby</a></b>) and Quinn King (<b><a href=#>Constance Zimmer</a></b>) faced off against Coleman Wasserman (<b>Michael Rady</b>) and humiliated contestant Yael (<b>Monica Barbaro</b>).</p><p><span>As the episode opened, Rachel revealed to Coleman that she had uncovered the truth about his award-winning documentary — namely, that he’d faked some of the key footage. (Oops.) Rachel agreed to keep his secret safe, as long as he returned the favor. Coleman responded by telling Rachel that it was “sad” that her whole life revolved around </span><i>Everlasting</i><span>, and vowing, “This is not over.”</span></p><p><span>He then met up with Rachel’s ex Jeremy (</span><b>Josh Kelly</b><span>), who was also recently fired from the show. Banking on the fact that Jeremy would have an ax to grind, Coleman invited the ousted director of photography if he wanted to help “shut that show down.” Spoiler alert: He did.</span></p><p><b>Quinn Plans Her Grand Finale</b></p><p>Back on set, Quinn planned her triumphant finale, which she was sure would be a ratings bonanza. She also spotted a gold anklet on Tiffany (<b>Kim Matula</b>) and realized Chet (<b>Craig Bierko</b>) was sleeping with her. (Apparently, he gave ankle bracelets to all of his conquests.)</p><p><span>Quinn’s plan was a simple one: Tell both remaining contestants, Tiffany and Chantal (</span><b>Meagan Tandy</b><span>), that they were the one Darius (</span><b>B.J. Britt</b><span>) had chosen, not only to propose to — but also to marry. On live TV. That night. Get each girl dressed as a bride, have Darius pick Tiffany, and then bring out Yael to reveal that Tiffany had been sleeping with Chet. (As an added bonus, Quinn would be able to end the relationship between her ex and the pretty blonde, who she instructed to break it off with Chet ASAP.)</span></p><p>Things started out well. Rachel successfully got Yael on board (despite having humiliated her just days before), Madison (<b>Genevieve Buechner</b>) wrangled Tiffany’s father and Chantal’s dying grandmother to attend the ceremony, and Tiffany sent Chet packing.</p><p><b>Jeremy Has a Change of Heart</b></p><p>Coleman finalized his own plans for the finale, which included using Yael’s live air time so that she could reveal the truth behind last season’s contestant, Mary, and how exactly she died. (ICYMI, the truth about what happened to Mary at the hands of the producers would likely land many of them in jail.)</p><p>As they planned their takedown of the show, Coleman told Jeremy how Rachel had admitted that when she was 12, one of her mom’s patients had raped her, and that is what started her down the path of being treated, and drugged, by her own mother for most of her life. Instead of inspiring Jeremy, this information gave him a change of heart. He broke onto the set and warned Rachel about Yael’s plans just as Yael was about to take her seat in front of the cameras.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><b><i>Everlasting</i> Goes Out With a Bang</b></p><p>As planned, Chantal and Tiffany both freak out when they see the other dressed up in full bridal wear — but so does Darius. Oh, one other thing: Darius had not been consulted about the plan that he would actually marry the winner that night. Darius took five to consult with his “best man,” Romeo (<b>Gentry White</b>) — who made a rather miraculous recovery after being shot — and his friend and manager did attempted to convince the former pro football player that he needed to marry Tiffany.</p><p><span>Meanwhile, Coleman told Rachel that he’s going to get ahead of her and out himself about faking his documentary so that he can burn her empire to the ground. He also revealed that he and Yael were going to the press as soon as the finale was done to air all of the show’s dirty laundry. Rachel scrambled to get a reporter on set to discredit Yael, but she knew that effort would prove temporary at best.</span></p><p><b>Ruby Shines Like a Diamond</b></p><p>This is where Quinn’s plan veered entirely off-course. First, Darius said that he could not “in good conscience” marry either Tiffany or Chantal. Then Ruby appeared. It turned out that Jay (<b>Jeffrey Bowyer</b>) had reached out to the cut contestant and told her Darius was in trouble — and she’d actually come to help him.</p><p>Darius got down on one knee and proposed to her, only for her to say no. “We’ve known each other for nine weeks. That’s crazy,” she said. “I love you. You know that. Let’s get away from all these cameras and see what’s there and see what we could have together for real, just you and me.” This rare moment of real feelings led the crew to erupt in applause … while Quinn began to cry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><b>Jeremy Goes Rogue</b></p><p>Jeremy then found Rachel and told her he hadn’t known what she’d suffered as a child and that he still loved her. Though she was adamant they were done and there was no hope for them to get back together, Jeremy was hardly listening. “We’re all going to jail!” Rachel cried as Jeremy pleaded his case for them to rekindle their romance. (They weren’t exactly on the same page here.) “There is nothing that anybody can do to stop it!” Rachel added.</p><p>At that moment, Yael and Coleman peeled out from the mansion in his sports car, and Darius and Ruby left in the “Just Married” limo. A disheartened Rachel peeled free from Jeremy, found Quinn, and broke the news that they’d lost. The show’s secrets were about to be exposed. Both women were resigned to their fates … but it turned out that Jeremy wasn’t.</p><p><span>Later that evening, when Rachel, Quinn and Chet were nursing their battle wounds and gazing up at the stars by the Everlasting mansion’s pool, Jeremy returned looking glassy-eyed and stunned. “You don’t have to worry about them ever again,” he mumbled as he sat down with the group. He then looked at Rachel and added, “I told you I’d do anything.”</span></p><p>Breaking news blared across the TV with word of a terrible car crash alongside footage of what was clearly Coleman’s sports car, its Everlasting license plate in clear view. The once flashy vehicle was reduced to a pile of mangled rubble and smoke as the anchor said there was no confirmation of the fate of the people who had been inside.</p><p>Tell <i>Us</i>: What did you think of the <i>UnREAL</i> season finale?</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>UnREAL</i> airs on Lifetime Mondays at 10 p.m. ET. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKynqpWWuW6yyKeYpZ1dp66ktMSlqmadqGKxsLHSZquhnV2qu7W0yKeimpqcmnqquoysq66mnp67qHnTsKCsrF2sgXR%2FkmlvaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-mark-levinson-age-wiki-biography-kim-cattrall-ex-husband-age-net-worth-children-and-wiki-facts-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Mark Levinson?
