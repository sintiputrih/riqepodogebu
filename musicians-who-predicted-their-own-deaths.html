According to <a href=#>Spin</a>, at only 22 years old, the singer "already had one gold and two platinum albums to her credit," while also embarking on what was to be a fruitful career as an actor, too. Simply put, Aaliyah was at the peak of her success.</p><p dir=ltr>With three albums under her belt, in August of 2001, Aaliyah jetted off to the Bahamas to film a music video for her single, "Rock the Boat," per <a href=#>Rolling Stone.</a> As revealed by VH1's "<a href=#>Behind the Music</a>," the singer was "anxious" to first board the plane heading to Abaco Island, yet reluctantly agreed. Aaliyah's boyfriend, Damon Dash, told "<a href=#>The Real</a>" in 2016, "She was like, 'I don't like that plane ... It was a complicated situation, but she had to go do that video."</p><p dir=ltr>Sadly, Aaliyah's fears came true. On August 25, the singer and her crew were prepped to head back to Florida, boarding a 10-seat twin-engine Cessna 402B. Under a minute after takeoff, the plane crashed, with Aaliyah killed instantly (via Rolling Stone). According to <a href=#>MTV</a>, the music video's director, Hype Williams, still released "<a href=#>Rock the Boat</a>," hoping Aaliyah's fans "would enjoy it." Noting the obvious "pain" of the final product, he added, "that's all the more reason people would appreciate what we've done as a group."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kW5rbm1fosK0tcKimKerXay1sHnPq5ydoZOpsqV506GcoqpdpMSvecOemK2go2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./melissa-womer-biography-facts-about-jim-carreys-ex-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Melissa Womer Biography Facts About Jim Carreys Ex-wife</span></a>
