So I think it was a good move for me to start our relationship off on a good foot,” Godwin said.</span></p><p><span>“As I got to know Tom, I quickly realized that like even if I didn’t give him the number, that he’s a guy that wouldn’t have held on too long to that. But for me, my decision was literally just a respect thing.”</span></p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nfl-news-report-golf-legend-tiger-woods-was-on-his-way-to-meet-nfl-players-drew-brees-and-justin-herbert-before-car-accident?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2015-12-30T080534Z_1_LYNXMPEBBT08H_RTROPTP_3_GOLF-300x240.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">REPORTS: Golf Legend Tiger Woods Was on his Way to Meet NFL Players Drew Brees and Justin Herbert Before Car Accident</p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2015-12-30T080534Z_1_LYNXMPEBBT08H_RTROPTP_3_GOLF-300x240.jpg><p>Godwin further said that he hopes to receive the same treatment during the twilight years of his career.</p><p><span>“One thing I hope is that down the road, if I’m ever in that similar situation, that like a young guy would respect me and respect the work that I’ve done my entire career to let me get the number from him,” Godwin said.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Pittman not in the wrong</h2><p><span>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers WR though pointed out that it isn’t necessary for Pittman to follow in his footsteps. At the end of the day though, he felt his decision was the right one to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Maybe Carson wants a different number, and like maybe they discussed that. I can’t really be one to tell you if a guy’s making the right decision or not.
