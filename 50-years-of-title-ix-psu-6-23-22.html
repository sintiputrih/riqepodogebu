(WJAC) — </span>Thursday marked the 50th anniversary of Title IX becoming law. The landmark law's had an impact on the lives of American women, and people in Centre County celebrated its signing at Penn State University.</p><p>It was a long, difficult march to achieve Title IX. Penn State celebrated that on Thursday by marching from the "We Are" statue to Old Main, where they held a rally.</p><p>6 News spoke with the university's president and athletic director about this milestone.<br></p><p>On Jun. 23, 1972, President Richard Nixon signed Title IX into law.</p><p>"Do you think this anniversary means more now than ever?" 6 News asked Penn State new president, Neeli Bendapudi.</p><p>"I do. I think for so many reasons of everything that's happening right now, it's wonderful to have an opportunity for us to celebrate something that has truly made such a difference in so many lives and to think about what can actually happen in the next 50," she replied. "We all need that sense of hope."</p><p>Title IX says: "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity."</p><p>That sentence adorned the shirts of many trekking through Penn State's University Park campus Thursday.</p><p>While those marking 50 years had much to celebrate, some say this anniversary comes at a crossroads for women's rights in America.</p><p>"I think every time that people come together — men, women, however you identify — that's the voice of the people," Ruth Williamson, an advocate from the Centre County Domestic and Sexual Violence Resource Center, told 6 News. "And that's how we cry out to say, what is most important is that equality and a chance at equal rights. And that's what we all deserve."</p><p>Marking the anniversary, the U.S. Department of Education proposed changes to Title IX on Thursday, to strengthen protections against sexual harassment, for the LGBTQ+ community, and more.</p><p>"I think anything that strengthens the opportunity for every single student to feel like they belong and to reach their potential is something that we would welcome, as educators," Bendapudi said about the proposal.</p><p>"I love the fact that Penn State was always a pioneer," the university's president added. "You heard how Penn State already had women's athletics eight years before Title IX. And I do know that Penn State was one of the very first universities in the entire country to actually allocate those scholarships. So, I love that. So, it's wonderful to be able to build on strength."</p><p>Women working in athletics whom we spoke to at the "Roar and Rally" event expressed nothing but gratitude for Title IX.</p><p>"Being a woman working in athletics, I wouldn't be where I am without Title IX, for sure," Amanda Howett, the athletic director for Penn State Shenango, told 6 News. "And I wouldn't have any of my female student athletes either. So, I mean, that's just an impact in and of itself and seeing women all around campus administration and supporting our athletic programs and seeing other women...working in athletics is just huge."<br></p><p>"I benefited from Title IX, I was able to play little league on the boys' team and I actually even played a year of football," Patrice Lombard, Penn State Hazleton's athletic director, chimed in. "So, it kind of opened up doors that would've never been opened and, you know, just having these opportunities for my generation, for Amanda's generation, and for the next generation coming up is huge."</p><p>"Personally, I wouldn't have been able to play as many sports in college as I did if Title IX didn't exist, which then led me to a career working at the athletic department after graduation," Penn State Scranton head softball coach, Mar Tsakonas, said. "So, I mean, this is just a big, monumental thing that was passed back in the 70s that we can only hope to improve on as the time goes on."</p><p>Penn State's departing athletic director, Sandy Barbour, told 6 News she couldn't even dream of serving as director for one of the top athletic programs in the country, when she was younger.</p><p>"No," she explained. "I mean, that was hard to imagine because I couldn't — there weren't any other women that I could see in those positions that led me to believe that that might be something that I could dream to."</p><p>"And then, eventually, there were women that were in athletic director positions — not very many, but there were women that made me say, 'Yes, I can.'"</p><p>Something echoed frequently throughout the day was further advancing equality.</p><p>"Well, the opportunities are not fully equal," said Barbour. "We're still, you know, whether it's statistics or it's kind of anecdotal about women in education, 'cause again, Title IX goes back to education. Having the exact equal opportunities that men do, we're not there yet. And until we're there, the work is not done."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7y6iamqRfan1uxcSaqaxln5t6tbXTpZxmoahivbTBjG9ka2tdZ38%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jalex-rosa-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-569180-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jalex Rosa Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
