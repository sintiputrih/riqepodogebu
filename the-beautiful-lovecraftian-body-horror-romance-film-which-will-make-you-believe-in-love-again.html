One of their finest, however, is arguably their least spoken about.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Thanks to the marvels of modern streaming, their second film <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring</a></strong> came into my watchlist and has stuck deeply with me. The body horror romance flick is one of their most daring films, with the 2014 release unfortunately not receiving more attention. Meeting the Cronenberg body horror of Videodrome with the romance of the Before trilogy sounds fairly ridiculous, but it absolutely works.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/spring-movie-2.jpg><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Indie circuit veteran Lou Taylor Pucci plays a desperately down-on-his-luck bar chef Evan, who is reaching the final days of caring for his terminally ill mother. Stuck without any hopes or aspirations after his mother dies, he decides on a whim to fly to Italy with his mother’s inheritance. Backpacking fairly aimlessly, he soon crosses paths with a mysterious woman (Nadia Hilker) in a small tourist town in southern Italy.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Enamored by Louise, he soon strikes up a romance that convinces him to move to Italy permanently and become a farmer so he can stay with her. The intrigue around her only deepens when she begins to evolve in bizarre ways, leading to a full-body transformation she can no longer control.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>The simple premise and picturesque setting really allow for Spring to feel like a summer romance, with the horror aspects in the background of a real human story. What is the difference between love and lust, and is there really such a thing as love at first sight?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/spring-movie.jpg><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>The horror is still stunning, with the film not antagonizing Louise as a monster despite some really horrific body transformation sequences and a few rabbit-related incidents. I think this is Benson and Moorhead’s best film due to the chemistry of Pucci and Hilker, who feel like genuine people, and the writing of their conversations is key to that.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>More than that, it’s a really poignant analysis of what the next stage of human evolution is, and societal standards of beauty being based on concepts of health and conventional beauty. Being someone with Crohn’s disease and liver issues, I am deathly afraid of my own body but also fascinated by what it can do, and how my health shapes who I am.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>Disabled people are often left on the outer of society, and definitely on the outskirts of modern dating scenes. Spring’s message is one about love transcending physical properties and looks to an idea of beauty much more inner. The cerebral and heartwarming story of Spring makes it stand out as one of the best horror films of the 2010s.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>Benson and Moorhead’s ability to convey amorous attention as something different from lust really powers this ahead. Many other directors and writers would’ve focused far more on the sexual aspects of their relationship. The duo instead focuses on what actual relationships are — which is talking and spending time with someone you care deeply for.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>If you want to check out Spring for yourself the film is available to stream now on Shudder and AMC+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJmnZ6ZpKq%2FprCOrZ%2BeZZKarrbAyJ%2BspWWcpMOmr9Gana2hkaN6o7vDsmShp6KnvLN50aikmqaTmnqntcumZLCgmZi1bsPIpaNmpZGgsm7Fzq5km52cnrK3sYyipWakn6uybq3GmqCnZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rachel-recchia-bachelorette-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-599359-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rachel Recchia Bachelorette Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Bi</span></a>
