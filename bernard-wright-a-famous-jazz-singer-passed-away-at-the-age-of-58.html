He began as a studio musician and went on to create four solo albums.&nbsp;He attended the High School of Performing Arts in New York after growing up in Jamaica, Queens. Carl Hancock Rux, a writer, and Desiree Coleman Jackson, a gospel music singer, were among his students.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bernard-Wright-1.jpeg alt="Bernard Wright" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He was just 13 when he was given a spot tour with Lenny White, and when he was 16, he performed with Tom Browne. In 1981, he was signed to GRP Records and released his debut album, Nard. Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, Skee-Lo, LL Cool J, and others sampled the tunes.&nbsp;Funky Beat was his second single on Artista in 1983, followed by Mr Wright on Manhattan Records in 1985. The latter album also had his most major R&B performance, Who Do You Love, which was accompanied by a video.</p><p>In 1990, Wright published the gospel CD Fresh Hymns, and in 2000, he formed a trio with Alfredo Elias and Damon Banks. Back To Our Roots is the title of their first album.&nbsp;Bernard has also been on records by performers such as Miami. Miles Davis, Cameo, Bobby Brown, Charles Earland, Doug E. Fresh, Pieces of a Dream, and Marcus Miller are among the performers. In Dallas, he also performed keyboards and served as a mentor to younger musicians.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bernard-Wright-2.jpg alt="Bernard Wright" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>He is said to be the godson of singer Roberta Flack. Flack‚Äôs big tracks include The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, Feel Me Makin‚Äô Love, Where Are the Love, The Closer I Get to You, and more.&nbsp;Flack is also known for her impact on the quiet storm style of modern R&B.
