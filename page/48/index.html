[Intro]
Pain - without love,
Pain - I can't get enough.
Pain - I like it rough,
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all.[Verse 1]
You're sick of feeling numb,

When happiness doesn't work.
Trust me and take my hand,
When the lights go out you will understand.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Buccaneers' 2023 draft pick Cody Mauch comes with toothless signature look</h2><time>Jul 26, 2024</time>
