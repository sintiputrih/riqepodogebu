Wassup baby?
This is a night that you'll never forget
Of all the things that you desire
I got it right here baby
Guess what?
I'm back

Baby the mood is right and the stars are out tonight
I can't wait til you get home
I got some rose petals leading to the bedroom door
Where I'm waiting all alone
With candles lit glass of perignon
