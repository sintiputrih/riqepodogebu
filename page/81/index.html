[Verse:]
Walking through a crowd, the village's aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before

Trials of an Intel Quad Processor System: 4x E5-4650L from SuperMicro
In recent months at AnandTech we have tackled a few issues of dual processor systems for regular use, and whether having a dual processor system as a theoretical scientist may help or hinder various benchmark scenarios.&nbsp; For the problems that I encountered as a theoretical physical chemist, using a dual processor system without any form of formal training dealing with memory allocation (NUMA) resulted in a severe performance hit for anything that required a significant level of memory accesses, especially grid solvers that required pulling information from large arrays held in memory.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Does brick have an R value?</h2><time>Jun 4, 2024</time>
