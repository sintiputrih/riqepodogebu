Paint yourself a picture
Of what you wish you looked like
Mayby then they just might
Feel an ounce of your painCome into focus
Step out of the shadows
It's a losing battle
There's no need to be ashamed
Cause they don't even know you
All they see is scars
They don't see the angel
Living in your heart
Let them find the real you
Buried deep within
Let them know with all you got</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Aqua Energy (EX Team Magma vs Team Aqua 86)</h2><time>Aug 30, 2024</time>
