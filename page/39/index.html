<a href=../../assessing-ibms-power8-part-1.html></a>
Benchmark Selection Our testing was conducted on Ubuntu Server 15.10 (kernel 4.2.0) with gcc compiler version 5.2.1.
The choice of comparing the IBM POWER8 2.92 10-core with the Xeon E5-2699 v4 22-core might seem weird, as the latter is three-times as expensive as the former. However, for this review, where we evaluate single thread/core performance, pricing does not matter. As this is one of the lowest clocked POWER8 CPUs, an Intel Xeon with a high base clock - something that's common for Intel's chips with fewer cores - would make it harder to compare the two microarchitectures.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Bob Sapp Related to Warren Sapp?</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>

The first Nier: Automata raid is now playable in Final Fantasy 14, which means there are new extremely cool outfits to get, including 2B’s outfit.
2B’s iconic dress can be earned by clearing The Copied Factory, the new 24-player raid. After beating the last boss, three players will randomly get a set of 2B’s clothes.

However, even though the movie doesn’t feature any web-slinging, shield-throwing, or heat vision (at least not that we noticed on our first watch), critical darling EverythingEverywhere All at Once, with its reality-bending visuals and literal multiversal theme can easily be mistaken for a genre film and has some audiences wondering if they should’ve waited to leave the theater until after the lights came up.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/38/>← Prev Page</a>
