I dream of Chloe and Kevin splitting up – he’s acting like a grumpy ol’ grandpa lately, and really ticked me off with his attitude to Carmine’s apology. When you compare Kevin and Carmine’s transgressions, Carmine comes out looking like a boy scout!

Back in 2020, the legendary artists from Chicago and Missouri united (in a posthumous manner) for "Godzilla." That track calls Music To Be Murdered By home. However, this single, fresh off the presses may we add, belongs to Juice and his team. All three have just come together for "Lace It," presumedly the second single from Jarad Higgins' last album, The Party Never Ends.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>meteorologist Archives - Page 3 of 12</h2><time>Aug 3, 2024</time>
