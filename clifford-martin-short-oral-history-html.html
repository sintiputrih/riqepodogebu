Released in April 1994, it opened at a disappointing seventh at the box office, behind the sequel to Major League, the sequel to The Mighty Ducks, and the second sequel to Naked Gun. It endured <a href=#>some</a> <a href=#>of</a> <a href=#>the</a> <a href=#>most</a> <a href=#>negative</a> <a href=#>reviews</a> a film could ever hope to avoid; in a half-star pan that declared the movie “irredeemably not funny,” Roger Ebert wrote that there was “something extraterrestrial about it, as if it’s based on the sense of humor of an alien race with a completely different relationship to the physical universe.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrc4null002k3h6eqyryzydb@published data-word-count=14>“What we have here is a suitable case for deep cinematic analysis,” Ebert concluded.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrc4null002l3h6ej7r40i9r@published data-word-count=133>Short was 40 when he starred in Clifford, playing the titular ten-year-old character. The effect is unsettling. Clifford is neither boy nor man. He’s a raging storm of desire, chocolate cravings, and Ethel Merman impressions that has assumed human form. Suffice it to say you don’t watch Clifford to go on the hero’s journey. But sure, there’s plot. When his Uncle Martin (<a href=#>Charles Grodin</a> at his prickly best) reneges on a promise to fulfill Clifford’s dream of visiting the Dinosaur World amusement park, Clifford embarks on a sadistic revenge mission to humiliate Uncle Martin in front of his boss (Dabney Coleman) and estrange him from his child-loving fiancée, Miss Sarah Davis (Mary Steenburgen). Moviegoing audiences didn’t take to it. But thanks to <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-1 tabindex=0>persistent airings on basic cable,</span> Clifford built a small, devoted following.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrc4nulm002m3h6exl4jgkot@published data-word-count=70>Twenty-seven years after its release, <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-2 tabindex=0>simply because nobody told me not to,</span> I decided to track down the people who made Clifford, as well as some of those fans who discovered it later. <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-3 tabindex=0>Actors</span> and filmmakers, viewers with unexpected connections to the story, and some people with barely any relationship to it at all gathered to offer the deep cinematic analysis Ebert suggested and Clifford — beautiful, crazy, misunderstood&nbsp;Clifford —&nbsp;deserves.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckrc4orgb002w3h6e35fijqun@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Oh, That’s Gonna Bomb”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7ce5000s3h6fuftxfftv@published data-word-count=59>For many of the people I spoke with, it had been years since they’d talked about Clifford — if they were ever asked to talk about the movie at all. To tell the story, it is necessary to go back to the very beginnings of the idea for the film. Which, surprisingly, predated even the involvement of Martin Short.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e0d00183h6fftpyh8d3@published data-word-count=40><strong>Steven Kampmann (co-writer, Clifford): </strong>You’re the first person I’ve talked to about this at all.

No one’s ever approached me about the making of the movie.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e0q00193h6fuucr1rxu@published data-word-count=89>I worked with <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-4 tabindex=0>Will Aldis,</span> who was my [writing] partner.&nbsp;And we had an idea about doing a funny version of The Bad Seed, which is a movie with the idea of a child being evil. I guess I always thought it was funny. We decided to pitch it to Orion [Pictures], where we had done <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-5 tabindex=0>Back to School,</span> so they were friendly about hearing from us. Will’s next-door neighbor’s son was named Clifford, and so we named the movie after him. In fact, [the neighbor] is a well-known actor.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e0r001a3h6f2gi7qzg5@published data-word-count=62><strong><span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-6 tabindex=0>Ken Olin</span></strong> <strong>(the neighbor):</strong> I mean, our son’s name is Clifford, after his maternal grandfather, and I think that they just liked the name? I don’t even know the movie, frankly. The character wasn’t at all based on Clifford. I think Will Aldis just found that to be a funny name for a boy.&nbsp;I don’t even know if my son saw it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e0s001b3h6fh6ga98rr@published data-word-count=12><strong>Clifford “Cliff” Olin (Ken’s son): </strong>I’ve seen it.

I have always checked with my parents: “That is a fact, right? That movie was named after me?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e0u001e3h6fyum36xir@published data-word-count=108><strong>Kampmann:</strong> I came in [to Orion], and I acted out every scene of the movie. Will and I loved to do the pitches. We’d basically outline where we wanted it to go. It wasn’t every perfect scene, but it was enough to know the basic structure of it so they could see it. They got the comedy of it. I was coming off a movie that I co-directed with Will, called <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-7 tabindex=0>Stealing Home.</span> Will wasn’t as interested in directing as I was; he was kind of a writer’s writer, so I wanted to direct it. We pitched the idea that I would direct and we would write it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e0v001f3h6f5h826iui@published data-word-count=192>Will and I had been partners onstage at Second City in Chicago. When we wrote together, we recognized that the voice that we used was neither his nor mine but kind of a unique voice. Because we performed for two years together many, many hundreds of shows and improvs, we had a very easy way of improvising. I would say, in general, in my career, I’ve been considered the structure person. Will had a great strength for dialogue. And together, we both had a good sense of building the character. So our process was we would leave town, and we took with us a guy named John Bates — who also has passed away, unfortunately — and we would go to the mountains. Will and I would sit in different seats, and we would then do dialogue, and John would get it down on the computer. What was remarkable about our process was the quantity of work we could do. We generally would go to Taos, New Mexico, for a week at the most. We always returned with a script of at least 120 pages. And that was the process on Clifford.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e0y001g3h6fkbe9djfk@published data-word-count=59><strong>Marc Platt (then-president of production at Orion Pictures): </strong>As I recall, the producers of the film were Larry Brezner, who has since passed, and Buddy Morra, who were managers. I believe they were Marty’s managers. They had a deal with us at Orion. They produced a couple of films, like the [Danny] DeVito movie Throw Momma from the Train.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e0y001h3h6fh1x9qyvu@published data-word-count=123><strong>Pieter Jan Brugge (producer/unit production manager, Clifford):</strong> It started with Larry Brezner, who was, aside from being a producer, also the manager of a lot of comedic talent. He was, at the time, part of Rollins, Joffe, Morra, and Brezner, which was a management group that represented the lion’s share of the great comedic talents in the United States: Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Martin Short. Larry developed this script, and he invited me in as his co-producing partner. I became aware of the script and I thought it was hilarious. Larry was someone who was creative, who had unbelievable instincts of what was funny and how to put the right people together. I had knowledge about movie making and putting a film together.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e11001i3h6fg57l33v6@published data-word-count=143><strong>Kampmann: </strong>Larry was funny, and he got the idea, and so he got attached to it. We messed around with it some more. Then we got actually greenlit by Orion to make it. So this was going to be casting a child with the storyline that pretty much is in the movie as it is. But Larry got a little concerned that there was another movie coming out with John Ritter called <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-8 tabindex=0>Problem Child.</span> So the concern there was, you know, do we try to get out before they get out? What happens if we don’t? He had decent concerns about it. It was my understanding Larry put a halt to it. We actually had a greenlit movie that got a halt, which you don’t see every day. It was suddenly going to be shelved. And I had the idea … of Marty.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e12001j3h6fxrqawhuy@published data-word-count=17><strong>Martin Short (actor, “Clifford Daniels”): </strong>It was Steve Kampmann’s idea to have me play a little boy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdv7e12001k3h6frov7u7ds@published data-word-count=61><strong>Ken Olin: </strong>When you picture somebody calling Marty Short <strong>—</strong> dressed up like a little boy<strong> — </strong>Clifford, I think they thought that was funny.

That’s your agenda. And when sometimes something doesn’t connect at all to the public, you can look at it and say, Well, it’s not very good. That’s why; that’s one thing. Or you can think, I would have thought there were more unusual people to find this funny out there. I guess I was off, or that your comedy is specific to what you think is funny, and maybe that’s too odd for the room. So when the room starts to get a sense of what you were trying to do, it’s amazingly gratifying.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdwg64x00yo3h6fz1fkvscl@published data-word-count=69>People love an underdog, so it’s nice when anyone comes up and says how much “blank” meant to them: “Oh my God, my four daughters got married and every night before every wedding, we’d watch Father of the Bride I and II.” Well, that’s lovely. But if someone is talking about something less heralded, you go, “Oh, you like my son who is red-haired and unappealing? Wow. Thank you!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckrdwg64y00yp3h6fv4e056ep@published data-word-count=50><strong>Letterman: </strong>Every aspect of it defies what we know about the world, about life, about existence. But yet there it is, brightly lit up. I’m just pleased for everybody who was in it. I don’t know what they thought when they were making it. It’s a piece of wonderment now.</p><h2 class=title>One Great Story: A Nightly Newsletter for the Best of New York</h2>The one story you shouldn’t miss today, selected by&nbsp;New York’s editors.
