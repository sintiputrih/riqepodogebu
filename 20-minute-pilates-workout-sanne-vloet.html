Finish with a 30 second plank.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Following your intense workout, Sanne has some advice on how to maintain your health and fitness as we enter into the summer months. “I think finding balance is key! This applies to not only nutrition and physical activity but also your overall mental state. Health is something we need to prioritize and should not take for granted,” she explained. “My advice is to cook homemade meals with fresh ingredients. You become more aware of what you put in your body when you cook yourself. For fitness, I suggest finding something you enjoy doing. This could be running outside, doing yoga or weightlifting. If you enjoy the activity, you are more likely to be consistent.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>She continued, “Something that has helped me in the past is planning out your health & fitness schedule. Set aside time at the beginning of each week to plan out your meals, groceries and workouts, and meditation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH12e5BsZmtoXaK2r8HTnmSpoZyWwaa%2FjLCmq6OfqsFuv8CnpZ5lpqG8psCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shellee-renee-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Shellee Renee Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
