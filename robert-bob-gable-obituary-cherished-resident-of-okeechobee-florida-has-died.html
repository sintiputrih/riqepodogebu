Known for his thoughtfulness, creativity, humor, and strong work ethic, Bob left a lasting impact on those who were fortunate enough to know him. His attention to detail was a hallmark of his character, evident in both his personal and professional pursuits.</p><p>As the longtime owner of Architectural Services of Okeechobee, Bob made significant contributions to the community by designing numerous residential and well-known commercial buildings. Beyond his architectural achievements, Bob had a passion for food and wine, creative writing, and music. He often delighted his family and friends by showcasing his culinary skills and playing the harmonica. Bob is survived by his devoted wife of 43 years, Carol Gable, their daughter Erika Gable (Andrew), son Benjamin Gable (Catelyn), grandson Archie Gable, and sister Bunny Behm. He was preceded in death by his parents, Sidney and Pearl, and sister Loretta.</p><p>Originally hailing from Newton, Massachusetts, Bob’s journey brought him to Hollywood, Florida, during his childhood. He continued to live in South Florida until his early 30s when he met and married Carol, a kindergarten teacher in Okeechobee County. They settled in Okeechobee, where they built a home designed by Bob and raised their family. A private celebration of Bob’s life will take place at a later date, providing an opportunity for family and friends to come together and pay their respects. In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests donations to Hospice of Okeechobee or Our Village Okeechobee as a meaningful way to honor Bob’s memory. Bob’s legacy will endure through the architectural masterpieces he created and the love and warmth he shared with his family and community.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwvs6bnKusXZe8o3nGmpmlnV2kr6rA1JqpsmWTnbKztdKhnJ1loprAqrDEp6tmp5ZivKyxxJyfqJqVmnqnuM6roJ2ZXZ2utHnDopydZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nathan-cajina-net-worth-312720.html><span>←</span><span>Nathan Cajina Net Worth</span></a>
