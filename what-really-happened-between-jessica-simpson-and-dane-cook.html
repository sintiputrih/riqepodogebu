They allegedly had a brief romantic rendezvous around that time, following Simpson's marriage to Nick Lachey, but nothing serious happened between Cook and Simpson. The goofy movie that brought them together — which scored a measly 20% on <a href=#>Rotten Tomatoes</a>&nbsp;— spawned a few questions years later. On a 2014 episode of&nbsp;<a href=#>"Watch What Happens Live,"</a>&nbsp;Andy Cohen asked Cook a series of questions in a version of "Plead the Fifth." If Cook didn't want to answer, co-guest Candy Crowley could squirt cheese into his mouth. Cook obviously hates squirtable cheese — who can blame him? – because he answered every single question without hesitation.</p><p dir=ltr>One of Cohen's questions was pretty mean. Referencing "Employee of the Month," Cohen asked what the dumbest thing was that Cook heard Simpson say on set. Cook responded, "She said one day, 'Are we making a movie?'" Cohen laughed and said, "That's dumb!" Ouch! In Cook's defense, it was Cohen who asked the question but honestly, he could have taken a mouthful of cheese instead. And we have a few questions ourselves, like why did Cook and Cohen think it was okay to talk about Simpson like that?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamloboFzgY6wn5qsXaeyorjLsmShmaClsq%2Bxw2aZnqynmrKvecmeqqyhk5Z6tLXMqaqopl2Wu6V5w5qlnmWTpLysew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nanu-masters.html><span>←</span><span>Nanu (Masters) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
