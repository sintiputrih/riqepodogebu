Not a lot of details exist about Summer Walker’s family background but it is known that both her parents are black. Her mother is however American while her father is British and a native of London. There is no record that the singer has any siblings.</p><h2><strong>What is Summer Walker’s Real Name?</strong></h2><p>Summer Walker’s real name is Summer Marjani Walker. The singer used the name her parents gave her for her stage name. She only dropped her middle name, Marjani, which reportedly has eastern African and Swahili origins and stands for coral which is quite beautiful. Ironically, the person that discovered Summer Walker’s music and helped her get a record label is also named Summer Walker.</p><h2><strong>Where is Summer Walker From?</strong></h2><p>Summer Walker is from Atlanta, Georgia. She grew up in Fulton County and was raised by her American mother. Her British father was largely absent during her formative years and this made things difficult for the family. She, therefore, had to take to cleaning houses in order to make a living. She also spent some time as a stripper all in a bid to pay the bills.</p><h2><strong>She Started Singing at the age of 15</strong></h2><p>Summer Walker began singing by the age of 15. She was initially motivated to do so because she was looking for <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">comfortable</a> and creative ways to make money. She however grew passionate about music as time went by.</p><p>Influenced by soul singers such as Jazmine Sullivan, Eryka Badu, and the late British singer, Amy Winehouse, Summer Walker taught herself how to play guitar from YouTube videos. She thereafter started posting song covers on YouTube and covered an eclectic mix of music from the likes of Beyoncé to Drake. Her song covers allowed her to perfect her harmonies and garnered her thousands of followers on YouTube.</p><h2><strong>She Released Her First EP at the Age of 22</strong></h2><p>Summer Walker’s song covers eventually caught the attention of a studio manager named Summer Walker and it was she that helped her to get signed to Love renaissance Record Label in 2017. Summer Walker released her first EP titled Last Day of Summer at the age of 22 and it spurned a hit single titled Girls Need Love.</p><p>The single was so popular with fans that Grammy-winning rapper and singer Drake easily agreed to feature on a remix of it. The remix was a hit as well and made it to the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100.</p><h2><strong>She Dropped Her First Album at the Age of 23</strong></h2><p>The success of Last Day of Summer spurred Summer Walker into working harder and she released her first full-length album, Over It, in October 2019. Summer Walker was aged 23 at the time she released her debut album and the album was a huge success. It debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums, making it the biggest debut for a female R&B artist in over ten years. It also spurned several hit singles such as Playing Games.</p><p>Summer Walker dropped her second studio album, Still Over It, at the age of 25 in November 2021. The album surpassed her first one and debuted atop the Billboard 200.</p><h2><strong>Summer Walker Won Her First Award at the Age of 23</strong></h2><p>Summer Walker won her first career award at the age of 23. This came at the 2019 Soul Train Music Awards where she was recognized as the best new artist. She has since gone on to win other awards. They include album of the year at the 2020 Soul Train Awards, best new R&B artist at the 2020 iHeartRadio Music Awards, top <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">R&B female artist</a> at the 2020 Billboard Music Awards, chart breaker award at the 2022 Billboard Women in Music Awards.</p><h2><strong>Summer Walker Welcomed Her First Child at the Age of 25</strong></h2><p>Summer Walker had her first child at the age of 25. The name of her daughter is not available but the father is a record producer known as London on Da Track (real name – London Tyler Holmes). Walker and London met around 2015 while she was still working as a stripper. They became good friends and collaborated on music including her first album. They later started dating.</p><p>Summer Walker and London on Da Track dated on and off for a few years and welcomed their daughter in March 2021. They have since broken up for good and Walker has accused her baby daddy of being a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">deadbeat dad</a> in several posts on Instagram. It seems that the music producer is doing better these days as Walker has not complained about him in recent times.</p><h2><strong>A look at Summer Walker’s Zodiac Sign</strong></h2><p>Summer Walker’s zodiac sign is Aries and those born under that zodiac sign are usually good-hearted and daring. They are said to display the care and compassion that is often missing in human endeavors and have the potential to do a great deal of good in the world.</p><p>Aries people are also known for being ambitious, honest, brave, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">creative</a>, good organizers, and optimists. Many of these certainly describe Summer Walker.
