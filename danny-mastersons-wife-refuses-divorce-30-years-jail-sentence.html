She tries to stay hopeful.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bijou, along with Masterson's family members, was present in the courtroom during Thursday's sentencing. In a courtroom sketch, the actor was observed blowing a kiss to his wife just before being escorted to prison.</p><p>While Bijou may be working with her husband and his legal team to explore their options, an earlier report said the actress was shocked when he was given a three-decade sentence.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was Danny Masterson The Highest-Paid Cast Member On That '70s Show?</a></span></p><p>“She wasn’t prepared for the verdict,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source said in June</a>, after Danny was found guilty of two counts of rape. “She never expected him to be found guilty. She couldn’t believe that he was taken into custody right away and remanded.” At the time, the source said Danny’s wife was “terrified about the sentencing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the source echoed the recent report’s sentiment that Bijou won’t be leaving her husband, despite the conviction. “No matter what happens though, Bijou supports him,” they went on. “She has no plans to leave him. Bijou, 43, and Danny, 47, have been married since 2011.</p><p>In 2020, Masterson faced charges of forcibly raping three women in separate incidents between 2001 and 2003. Following his arrest, he remained free on a $3.3 million bail. Then, in January 2021, he entered a not guilty plea to all three charges.</p><p>Last June, he was found guilty on two of the counts, while the third count led to a hung jury, with eight out of the jurors voting in favor of convicting the actor.</p><h2 id=many-famous-faces-requested-a-lenient-sentencing-for-danny>Many Famous Faces Requested A Lenient Sentencing For Danny</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/danny-masterson-mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite many famous faces writing to the court in support of Danny getting a lenient conviction, the That ‘70s Show star still received a decades-long sentence earlier this week.
