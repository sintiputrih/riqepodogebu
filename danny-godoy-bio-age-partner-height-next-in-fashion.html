He enrolled in the Fashion Design Program at FIDM-Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising right after receiving his diploma from City Honors High School in Inglewood, California. After earning his first degree (an AA in fashion design), Danny Godoy worked for Ted Baker London as a floor manager. <span>He reapplied a year later for the Advanced Fashion Design Program‚Äôs third-year debut and was selected as one of the 11 students to present his collection in March 2016.</span></p><p>Danny‚Äôs participation in his debut was a big accomplishment because he had applied the year before but was not accepted. This time, he was not only admitted to the program but also the recipient of the Nolan Miller Full Ride Scholarship. He refers to his target client as a classic showgirl.</p><p>Danny also discovered the DRAG Transformation art while he was a student at FIDM. Danny has made a name for himself in Southern California as a drag queen who performs full-time. GODOY recently changed his name from ‚ÄúBeverly Luxe,‚Äù the artist, to that name. Throughout the past ten years, GODOY has worked on a variety of projects including Master Class with Diane von Furstenberg, Project Runway Threads, Custom Clothing for RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race, RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race All-Stars, and RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race Live-Las Vegas.</p><p>Furthermore, he also prepared custom wear for Local Legends&nbsp;and for Drag Royalty: Naomi Smalls, Kim Chi, BOB, Raven, Raja, Manila Luzon, Ongina, Monique Heart, Monet Xchange, Tammie Brown, GottMik, Pandora Boxx, Morgan McMichaels, Mayhem Miller, Jiggly Caliente, Kelly Mantel, Willam Belli, and Mariah Balenciaga.</p><h3><strong>Danny Godoy Age</strong></h3><p>According to his IG post, Danny Godoy turned 28 years old in August 2022.

In other words, Danny is very secretive about the romantic aspects of his life and doesn‚Äôt flaunt it on his social media. With more than 200 posts on his IG, none of them suggest that he is currently romantically linked with anyone.</p><p>In one IG post, he referred to fitness model and fellow drag star Sadie Pines as his ‚Äú<a href=#>partner in crime</a>‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily they are dating each other.</p><p>Keeping that in mind, we can say that he is either happily single focusing on his career, or dating someone in secret.</p><h3><strong>Danny Godoy Height</strong></h3><p>Danny Godoy‚Äôs height measures under 5 feet 5 inches.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Who Are Danny Godoy Parents?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Danny Godoy was born to Mexican immigrant parents Maria and Sotero Godoy as the youngest of four children.

The story almost always starts with them not understanding what I do or am talking about. But they are always willing to listen, learn, and be parented by their children.
