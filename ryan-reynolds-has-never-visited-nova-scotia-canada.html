Not only is it known for its massive trees such as the western red cedar and Sitka spruce, but it also houses animals such as cougars, grizzly and black bears, wolves, salmon and much more. It's also home to the Kermode, or "spirit" bear, a rare black bear subspecies whose cubs sometimes have white coats.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7088b7f5a7ee-great-bear-rainforest-kermode-bears-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eRff5uQmYJX6 data-wc=30><strong>A Kermode or "spirit" mother bear with her cub in the Great Bear Rainforest.
