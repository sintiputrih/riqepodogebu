Caught in a strange, magical world, Chihiro must do what it takes to free herself and her parents from the curse and return to the real world.

On its release, Spirited Away was critically acclaimed for its art and narrative, with many describing it as “a dazzling, enchanting, and gorgeously drawn fairy tale.” The film also won Best Animated Feature at the 75th Annual Academy Awards and the National Board of Review, among several other awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Max</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kxKmx0Z5kraddrK61r8dmqq2tlJ68brPHopmloV2bsrTAjGtna2tdory3tcSsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-young-and-the-restless-spoilers-jordans-escape-strategy-fails-claires-aunt-gets-the-downfall-she-deserves.html><span>←</span><span>The Young and the Restless Spoilers: Jordans Escape Strategy Fails Claires Aunt Gets the D</span></a>
