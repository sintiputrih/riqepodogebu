Since Windows RT is mainly on tablet style devices, the Start Menu may actually not be that useful, so you can enable or disable the Start Menu through the taskbar properties on the desktop.</p><p>It functions much like the Windows 10 style one, including pinning apps and such, but the actual design of it appears to be closer to what was available on older versions of Windows 10 during the preview period.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9636/09-30startMenu_Page_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p align=center>Windows 10 Start Menu in early preview is very similar</p><p>The other Windows 10 feature coming is circular frames for user account pictures. Unlike the Start Menu though, there is no method to enable or disable this, it is just going to be there.</p><p>Much like Windows Phone 7.8, Windows RT is now a dead platform and Microsoft has given it the smallest of upgrades to end its life. Since it is not running the Windows 10 kernel, Windows RT will never have access to the Windows 10 store, nor the Universal Windows App platform which launched with Windows 10. It instead will forever stay on the older WinRT framework which debuted with Windows 8.</p><p>I would have liked to include screenshots from my own Surface RT for this post, but it stopped working a couple of months ago, and clearly there is no need to replace it.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>Microsoft Support</a> via <a href=#>ZDNet</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIZ3f5VopKKboqTAsLLTZqiuoZWpubp50aijpatdpMK1edaipZ2np6h6s8CMrqedmaSaerW7jJ6lmpqcmnq4tc2dprCrXWZ9br%2FTsqOeZaOprrPAjKacp60%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./law-order-svu-mariska-hargitay-mariska-hargitay-left-close-to-tears-rare-insight-into-home-life.html><span>←</span><span>Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU's Mariska Hargitay left clse to tears as she offers rare insight into home life</span></a>
