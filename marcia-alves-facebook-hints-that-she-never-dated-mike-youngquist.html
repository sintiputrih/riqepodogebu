The marathon runner and mother to one son was spotted in photos with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">90 Day Fiance</a> star in September 2021 following his split from Natalie.</p><p>Mike denied he was dating anyone during the Tell-All interview but his cast members claimed he was hiding the truth.&nbsp;They brought up the photos he featured in with Marcia after Natalie admitted she was currently dating.</p><p>Marcia once starred in Bret Michaels’ VH1&nbsp;reality dating show Rock of Love before the show ended. She then started her own shoe line, VanZant Shoes, in 2014. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ranker</a>, she was married in 2019.</p><p>She lived on a tour bus during the show and once kissed Bret Michaels after consuming several drinks on the first night.

She jokingly wrote on the platform that, after changing your relationship status three times or more, Facebook should default it to “unstable”.</p><p>More recently, Marcia posted a picture that states: “I blame Barney’s a** for making me believe if I love you… you love me. Fat purple bas***d.” Although it’s clear she’s using comedy, it looks like she’s no longer with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mike</a>.</p><p>Neither Mike nor Marcia have confirmed they are dating and, since photos of them drinking in a swimming pool first emerged as well as pictures of Mike with her son, they have only been spotted together once, in October 2021.</p><p>That was when they were seen partying together in Nevada. However, there haven’t been any more pictures of the two shared this year and he appears to be single on 90 Day Fiance, but there have been no confirmations.</p><p>A fan wrote on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>: “I don’t think Mike is dating that woman.

She has a K1 visa, which is said to be valid for 90 days.</p><p>Some viewers interpreted Natalie getting upset as her not wanting him to date anyone else.
