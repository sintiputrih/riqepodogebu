The kid was left home with his brother, and things went disastrously wrong when they tried out some chemistry.&nbsp;</p><p>Meredith and April were shocked that Andy knew to reach inside the wound and hold on for dear life. Alas, they had to get the kid to the OR in a swift manner because his pulse was weakening.&nbsp;</p><p>They did so, and Meredith tasked Andy with using a clamp to take her hand off of the aorta. Andy was surprised she managed to win. Hellmouth kept popping up with an important phone call regarding Meredith’s surgical procedure.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/sarah-drew-for-abc-821x1024.png><p>Ultimately, Andy took the phone call and unleashed holy hell on the man on the other side of the phone. She spoke in another language and managed to get Meredith the patent for the procedure.&nbsp;</p><p>Andy also had to go toe-to-toe with her new employee, Ben Warren. He was sticking his nose in at the hospital to make sure the two boys were getting the best care possible.&nbsp;</p><p>The other kid was in trouble because he had a skull fracture and glass embedded in his leg. Owen, Bailey, and Webber joined forces to save him, and they just managed it.&nbsp;</p><p>There were big issues in the OR because of the way everyone kept bickering over the way Miranda was operating on the patient.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there was Alex, DeLuca, and Amelia. They were stumped trying to find a way to save Kimmie. If you <a href=#>watch Grey’s Anatomy online</a>, you will know that Kimmie’s operation failed because if the tumor was removed, it would have taken her speech with it.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/meredith-grey-on-greys-anatomy-season-14-1024x739.png><p>The team tried to find a way to laser the tumor off, and despite some hiccups, they realized at the end of the hour that going at the tumor with multiple lasers was the best foot forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Jackson grew concerned because April was known as Dr. Party all around the hospital by the interns, and he was worried she was going down a dark path.&nbsp;</p><p>Arizona was not impressed with Jackson complaining, but she later changed her tune when she witnesses April on the bar with a bottle of tequila and screaming about getting drunk.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/10/ellen-pompeo-on-greys-anatomy-season-14-752x1024.png><p>Yeah, April is in for a tough time of it!</p><p>What did you think of the latest episode?</p><p>Hit the comments below!</p><p><strong>Grey’s Anatomy continues Thursdays on ABC!</strong></p><a href=#><img width=900 height=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/jo-wilson-greys-anatomy.jpg alt="17 Characters Who Ruined Perfectly Good TV Shows" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>17 Characters Who Ruined Perfectly Good TV Shows</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WAcLPRnrCsZZGjrrW7zLJkrJ2RqLyveZBtZJ6omai8pbGMampmqpWYrrF52KisZqqVlrmtxYygpq1lkWK1sLjDZqZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./theo-germaine-william-rusan.html><span>←</span><span>What Is The Tea Between Theo Germaine And William Rusan?
