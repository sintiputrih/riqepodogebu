The two took over a Hollywood tourist bus route and spilled their personal stories about Sunset Blvd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rather off the cuff, Paytas revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Saget</a> legally came after her because of disparaging comments she made about him on TikTok. Here's what we know so far.</p><h2 id=trisha-calls-him-creepy>Trisha Calls Him 'Creepy'</h2><p>In a stretch of the tour, Paytas said into her tiny microphone, "That's where I saw Bob Saget in real life!" as they passed a run-of-the-mill Starbucks, "Now he's suing me."</p><p>As loyal&nbsp;Frenemies fans, we had a feeling about why Saget was potentially setting his lawyers loose on the podcast host. She alleged that he was "creepy" on the set of&nbsp;Full House.&nbsp;In a past TikTok video, she compared the former sitcom actor to predators like Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>The March-released episode of&nbsp;Frenemies&nbsp;divulged into her rationalization behind posting the video. She claimed that a close anonymous friend encountered an uncomfortable situation with Saget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Within a day of posting the original TikTok clip, his litigation team contacted Paytas to take it down. She also included a tasteless joke that Saget performed, detailing doing inappropriate sexual acts to a toy baby doll while filming&nbsp;Full House.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trisha Paytas Says This Was "The Worst Experience Of Her Life"</a></span></p><p>Fast forward to today's vlog, Paytas said that she thinks he may still be pursuing legal action. She recalled paying for something that related to Saget but didn't go into further details.</p><h2 id=a-different-guy-from-full-house>A Different Guy From 'Full House'</h2><p>Saget is known for his raunchy comedy, which Klein made sure to point out when they discussed the fiasco. His jokes range from overdone sexual innuendos and insane punchlines that are delivered for the sheer purpose of shock.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An old YouTube clip from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Conan</a> detailed just how much fans' perspectives of him changed once&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;ended and they began to see his true personality.</p><p>One fan commented on the 2013 segment, "I’m actually surprised at myself of how much I admired Danny from full house to be such a loving dad to the girls, and now to hear that behind the cameras he was a sick man (still is), just ruined my whole memory of the show."</p><p>Another commenter equated his "humor" to a bad habit that he should have grown out of a long time ago, "What’s odd is that most guys go through that 12-15 year old phase where you think dirty stuff like this but then you grow out of it at one point, it’s like bob never did. What 50 year old guy talks like this?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Whose DMs Did Bob Saget Slide Into?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmmaiaXaiuqLHTZqqunZRiwbO10qGYZqiRrsGiv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ed-jasper-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Ed Jaspers biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</span></a>
