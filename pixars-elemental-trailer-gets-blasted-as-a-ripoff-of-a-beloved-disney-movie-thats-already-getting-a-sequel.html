As the trailer, which you can check out above, makes clear, the film is set in a city inhabited by beings made up of the four elements — air, water, earth, and fire. The story then sees two characters from two different groups making an unexpected connection.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>Hang on a minute. A cute urban animated movie that’s actually celebrating societal diversity and exploring harmful prejudices? We’ve heard this one before. Yup, Elemental is giving everyone some serious Zootopia vibes, with the 2016 fan-favorite even trending on Twitter in the wake of the trailer’s release — as folks accuse it of simply being a low-rent ripoff of the earlier hit, except with elements replacing animals.</p><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=87 data-injectable=false>This GIF choice gets even funnier when you remember <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zootopia‘s Breaking Bad gag</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pixar making incredible, revolutionary shader technology to make a less interesting remake of Zootopia <a href=#>https://t.co/xlrvuHFpZK</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jl01FVIAdM</a></p>— Yeenie (@Yeenie_Mcbeenie) <a href=#>March 28, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>But, hey, calling Elemental a Zootopia ripoff isn’t fair… It’s also ripping off Tangled.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tangled + Zootopia <a href=#>https://t.co/FQmRXeYtw9</a></p>— rey (they/he) 🐀 (@gaslightsaber) <a href=#>March 28, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=40 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>… And possibly Soul and Coco too.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>disney really needs to get back to their old fairytale formulas bc this is:<br>– zootopia (big city w division and two ppl from opposing sides get together)<br>– soul and coco (“but what do YOU want to do?”)</p><p>in a movie except with elements. <a href=#>https://t.co/FPROj9ejiJ</a></p>— 🦋🧜🏽‍♀️ || year of the mermaid (@aficionad0__) <a href=#>March 28, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=56 data-current-count=56 data-injectable=false>20 years can really drain a company’s creativity.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>How did pixar went from “those monsters in your closet actually work in a scaring company that use magic doors lol” to “zootopia with elementals”</p>— bruhman (@telecinemas) <a href=#>March 28, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>Others, meanwhile, are less concerned about the Zooptopia parallels as the deeper meaning of the story is really speaking to them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>What a clever way to make a story about interracial dating.

For the filmmaker, the key difference in these two fictional communities lies in the absence of any segregation in Element City:</p><p data-characters=591 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>“It’s not like in&nbsp;Zootopia, where everything is disconnected from each other,” Sohn told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a>. “It’s all about mixing,” Sohn says. “That’s what was so fun about this idea of: some elements can mix and some don’t. And what does that relationship look like? So water spilling onto earth people, that grows their plants. The idea of fire people needing wood to eat. There was a symbiotic relationship that they all needed to interconnect. And so we try to do that as much as we can in place. It’s not 100% everywhere, but it was definitely one of our building blocks.”</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>Fans will be the judge of whether Elemental is unique enough to be another Pixar classic once it releases this June 16. Either way, it’s clear Disney is desperately trying to recapture that sweet Zootopia magic, what with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an actual Zootopia sequel recently being announced</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJop6KwkafAbrHLnqSepqSWuW7A0ZqgpZ2iYrSmwNJmmaWZo6mypXnArGSaZaKevbCyxWamn2WRYq%2BmuM6vnJ1llJ7Ar7HYZqSorpmaerW0wK2qZpmcp7KisNhmnp6spJ67qHnAZqqeqaWauXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./operation-mincemeat.html><span>←</span><span>Operation Mincemeat, The Daring Scheme That Duped The Nazis</span></a>
