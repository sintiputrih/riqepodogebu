The reboot is reportedly set to be a continuation of the series. Now, Clarissa will be the mother of the family (ie. Girl Meets World and Raven’s Home).</p><p>The original series’ creator <strong>Mitchell Kriegman</strong> is in talks to write and executive produce, with Hart also executive-producing. She and her mother run their own production company, Hartbreak Films.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/melissa-joan-hart-clarissa-explains-it-all.jpg><p>CBS attempted to develop a reboot, titled Clarissa Now, in 1995, but the show was never picked up. The pilot did air later on Nickelodeon. Hart, 41, has also not responded to the report, but when a fan tweeted an excited GIF about the reboot, she gave it a like.</p><p>Hart also spoke to Us Weekly in November about the possibility of Clarissa coming back and relating to the role.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think it would have to be really smart and would have to make a lot of sense because it’s really hard to do those reunion shows because everyone will say they same thing: ‘Oh they look old, oh it’s not as good,’” the actress told Us at the time. “Sabrina wrapped up in such a perfect way, it gave a nice little bow on the package. Clarissa maybe there are some loose ends there that you can tie up. It would just have to be really smart.”</p><p>She also added that out of all her roles, she’d “identify with Clarissa the most.”</p><p>Nickelodeon had no comment regarding the new project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqlmaKewLStjJ6vqaSRnru0ecitZJqknGK%2Fpq7OqKtmqpWlvLPAxJ2jsmWZo3q1tMRmrqiqm6h8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-stone.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Stone</span></a>
