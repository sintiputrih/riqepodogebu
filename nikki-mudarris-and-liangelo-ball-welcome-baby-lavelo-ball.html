She wrote, “My son, you gave me a purpose in life. I promise to love you, guide you, protect you and be with you every step of the way. I promise to teach you right from wrong and be the best mommy to you I can be.”</p><p>She added, “I love you soooo much you changed my world, you make my heart so full and complete. The second I saw you I never felt a love I felt with you. I’m so thankful to have you and that you picked me as your mommy.”</p><p>Nikki Mudarris also thanked LiAngelo for his unwavering support during her labor, acknowledging the challenges they faced together.</p><p>She wrote, “To my baby <a href=#>@gelo</a> thank you for being so supportive of me, especially during my labor, it was hard, challenging and long but you were with me every step of the way encouraging me and reassuring me I could do it & I did. I could have never done it without you by my side. I love you so much I’m so grateful to experience this with you and raise our son together, he’s absolutely perfect. I’m so thankful to have you both. This is just the beginning of the very best chapter yet…”</p><p>Mudarris and Ball had previously revealed their son’s name, which holds special significance. It combines elements from LiAngelo’s family, paying tribute to his father, LaVar, with the first three letters of his name, and borrowing from his brother’s name, LaMelo, who plays for NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOp6Cko5liurawwKupoqtdlrulecuimKeflaG8bq7ApaNmr5WhsLC5xGaZmpqpYrmiwsSlpmaakaG5cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamie-lee-curtis-pride-for-her-trans-daughter-goes-beyond-wholesome-while-supporting-charity-efforts.html><span>←</span><span>Jamie Lee Curtis pride for her trans daughter goes beyond wholesome while supporting charity effo</span></a>
