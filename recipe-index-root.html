Here’s the thing: even though tofu might be labeled firm or extra-firm, it contains a lot of water. This excess water can cause the tofu to crumble when you cook it, and it will also have a hard time crisping up. But when you press tofu, you remove the excess moisture. It takes on a chewier, firmer texture, which makes it super satisfying to eat and less likely to fall apart.

If you don’t already have a go-to BBQ sauce recipe up your sleeve, let me introduce you to mine.

If you’re anything like me, you’ve rolled many a disappointing burrito in your day. Maybe the tortilla tore, maybe the filling spilled out the end of the burrito as you ate… Whatever happened, you didn’t end up folding—or eating—the Chipotle-worthy burrito of your dreams. I’ve been there. But a few years ago, after a particularly memorable burrito mess (please, don’t ask!), I finally figured out how to roll a burrito so that it wouldn’t leak or split. As it turns out, the process is super easy—you can find my step-by-step guide below.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Why buy taco seasoning in a packet when you can make your own?! This homemade taco seasoning recipe uses basic spices that you likely have in your pantry already, and you can stir it together in less than 5 minutes. Once you learn how to make it, you’ll never get the store-bought stuff again! One of the biggest reasons I make my own taco seasoning is that I can tweak the balance of flavors. The recipe below yields a blend I love—it’s savory and smoky with a subtle kick of heat.

Today’s post is a PSA: if you’re not already making homemade Spanish rice, it’s time to start. You’re seriously missing out! Spanish rice, also called Mexican rice or arroz rojo, is a type of rice pilaf cooked with onions and garlic, tomatoes, peppers, and spices. It’s commonly eaten throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, and it’s the perfect side dish for a simply cooked protein or Mexican fare like tacos and enchiladas.

These beauties are light and fluffy, and the buckwheat flour gives them a wonderful nutty flavor. Saturday morning, here we come. 🙂 While many buckwheat pancake recipes call for a mix of buckwheat flour and all-purpose flour or whole wheat flour, I use 100% buckwheat in mine. I love that you can really taste the buckwheat this way. It’s earthy and nutty, and it makes these pancakes a unique treat. They’re also naturally gluten-free, because despite its name, buckwheat isn’t actually related to wheat. You can read more on that below,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If I’m not eating summer strawberries straight out of the carton, I’m using them to make this strawberry compote recipe. It calls for just 4 ingredients, cooks up in 20 minutes, and tastes so good that I could eat half a batch straight off a spoon. This strawberry compote is lightly sweet, bright with lemon, and bursting with fresh strawberry flavor. It’s thick enough to spread on toast like jam, but it also makes a great topping for ice cream, pancakes, waffles, and Greek yogurt…the possibilities here are endless. And good news!

It’s creamy, it’s tangy, and it’s flecked with savory herbs, crunchy celery, and (optional, but delicious) hard-boiled eggs. I’ll be bringing it to every cookout and BBQ we attend this summer. This potato salad recipe is so tasty that I can’t get enough! It’s essentially the classic potato salad that appeared at every picnic and potluck throughout my childhood, but it has a few key twists.

It has a short list of fresh ingredients, you can toss it together in 20 minutes, and it’s sooo bright and refreshing. I love the variety of textures and flavors in this dish.
