Perhaps that's why there are hundreds of thousands of views on TikTok hashtags like "how to get rid of a double chin" and "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>jawline check</a>". On Zoom calls, the camera is pointing up at the face and neck. "It really highlights this area, so we are seeing an uptick of consultations for the neck area," says Sheila Nazarian, M.D., a board-certified plastic surgeon and founder of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Nazarian Plastic Surgery</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Google searches</a> for "how to get rid of a double chin overnight" and "double chin treatment options" have grown exponentially in recent years. And if you search "how to get rid of a double chin" on TikTok, you'll get a variety of answers, ranging from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>makeup contouring tricks</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>double chin injections and surgery</a>. However, it can be hard to know which of these "solutions" are actually worth your time — which is why turned to the experts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From in-office derm procedure to at-home techniques, here are some of the ways people are attempting to get rid of a double chin — and what doctors have to say about their effectiveness.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-causes-of-a-double-chin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Causes of a Double Chin</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A double chin is often tied to weight gain, but carrying extra fat around the neck could also be genetic, Dr. Nazarian says (just like some people might naturally carry weight in other areas of the body). The skin in this area tends to get looser as we age, too.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-get-rid-of-a-double-chin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Get Rid of a Double Chin</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the record, it's completely normal to have fat around the neck — and having what you perceive to be a double chin isn't something you should feel the need to change. But if you're looking for ways to tighten this area, we've compiled our favorite expert-approved methods for doing so.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-in-office-procedures></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>In-Office Procedures</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Consider InMode tightening and contouring treatments.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One popular method is called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>InMode Evoke</a>, a non-invasive treatment that plastic surgeons recommend frequently in place of liposuction. Basically, the applicator device releases radiofrequency energy to the layers underneath your outer layer of skin to offer "fat reduction and skin tightening benefits," Dr. Nazarian says. "Evoke tends to be a good option for people who want a non-invasive procedure," she adds. People often do at least three and sometimes as many as six treatments with one or two weeks in between to get more tightening results, she explains. The treatments come in a package of three treatments, and start at around $2,000, she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For those looking for more long-term results that will be more immediate, plastic surgeons might level up with a one-time, minimally-invasive procedure (it only requires local anesthesia) called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>InMode Facetite</a>. It's another, slightly more expensive radiofrequency contour procedure, Dr. Nazarian explains, and one she often uses in combination with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Morpheus 8</a>, a radiofrequency and microneedling technique that helps remove fat and tighten and remodel skin.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Consult your doctor about CoolSculpting.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For those who don't want to go under a knife for a procedure like neck liposuction or under any kind of anesthesia, CoolSculpting is a popular procedure. It uses a cooling applicator and vacuum-like suction to freeze fat cells, which the immune system then clears. "Coolsculpting is an effective treatment for neck fat if it is very soft fat," Dr. Nazarian explains (the more fat cells that are there, the more difficult it is to freeze them). The cost of CoolSculpting in the neck area starts at around $700.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">ICYMI, the procedure's been in the news after supermodel Linda Evangelista shared that it caused her to develop a condition called Paradoxical Adipose Hyperplasia (PAH), which makes fat cells enlarge rather than shrink. "The risk of PAH, as highlighted recently with Linda Evangelista, is very rare, but it can happen," Dr. Nazarian says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ask for a Kybella injection.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kybella is a popular injection for treating a 'double chin'. According to a report by the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>American Society of Plastic Surgeons</a>, plastic surgeons performed over 135,500 Kybella injections in 2020 and over 150,000 in 2019. Sometimes it's used in conjunction with Botox to dissolve fat cells and then relax the neck muscles with a goal of a tighter jawline. It typically costs between $900 and $1,000 per injection, which means it runs a bit cheaper than other procedures out there that treat the neck area, but you may need multiple treatments to see long-lasting results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, while studies have shown that it's safe and effective, you can expect intense swelling, bruising, and pain right for a couple of weeks after each injection,<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=1></span> so Dr. Nazarian explains her patients often opt for a minimally-invasive procedure like FaceTite instead, which only requires one office visit and very little downtime afterward, she adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-at-home-treatments></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>At-Home Treatments</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Discover the power of skin-sculpting tools.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For people who want to skip the plastic surgeon's office altogether, there are at-home tools, like those that use microcurrent technology. "Microcurrent is an ideal at-home treatment because it uses low levels of electricity to stimulate facial muscles and cell growth for an instant lifting and sculpting effect," explains Mona Gohara, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist. Dr. Gohara recommends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Trophy Skin RejuvatoneMD</a> for toning and tightening the skin of the face and neck. You can also adjust the intensity if you're hoping to turn the sculpting up or down a notch, she adds.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Try yoga — for your face and neck.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">TikTokers are also trying <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>facial and neck yoga exercises</a>, including one dubbed the 'anti-double chin exercise'. It involves tilting your head back and pressing your tongue firmly against the roof of your mouth to help strengthen your neck muscles, Dr. Gohara explains. Needless to say, this isn't a replacement for an in-office procedure. While these exercises might offer some preventative benefits when it comes to tightening the neck muscles, don't expect them to do much of anything when it comes to treating an existing 'double chin'. (It's the same theory behind why <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>you can't spot reduce fat</a> with exercise in any other part of your body). "If neck exercises and massages worked, we would be out of a job!" Dr. Nazarian jokes. Point taken.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Show your neck some TLC.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This applies to everyone, regardless of age: Make sure your neck is part of your skincare routine. "Consider the neck like the face — put on antioxidant serums and sunscreen in the morning and a little dab of collagen-building retinol in the evening," Dr. Gohara suggests. Before you apply your topical creams, you can stimulate blood flow in the neck area with small, gentle pinches, starting at the top of your neck and working vertically towards the bottom, she adds.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Brush up on your lymphatic massage techniques or gua sha skills.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How you apply product to your neck can also make a difference. Dr. Gohara suggests a lymphatic massage technique while you apply your cream: "Rub upwards and out to maximize circulation and drainage," she says. Don't be afraid to add pressure with the help of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gua Sha tool</a>, which can be useful to achieve some of that lymphatic movement (it feels great on the skin too, especially when you're puffy).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-to-see-a-professional></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When to See a Professional</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've given at-home treatments a shot and you're still not satisfied with the results, you might want to move on to an in-office procedure. Treatments carried out by a professional are oftentimes more powerful than those performed at home and may wield immediate and longer-lasting results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, you should consult your doctor if you experience any symptoms that may signal another health issue. For instance, a sudden swelling in your neck could be an indication that you have swollen lymph nodes or a thyroid condition, Dr. Nazarian says. So definitely talk to your primary care doctor about it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8eormasn2K0psCMq6CdZZ%2BbeqW71JujnmWTnbav</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-do-you-replace-a-broken-grease-fitting.html><span>←</span><span>How do you replace a broken grease fitting?</span></a>
