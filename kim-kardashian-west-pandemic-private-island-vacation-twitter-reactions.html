"Before COVID, I don't think any of us truly appreciated what a simple luxury it was to be able to travel and be together with family and friends in a safe environment. After 2 weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were normal just for a brief moment in time. We danced, rode bikes, swam near whales, kayaked, watched a movie on the beach and so much more. I realize that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right now, so in moments like these, I am humbly reminded of how privileged my life is. #thisis40"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The theatrical display of her lack of self-awareness and humility, and the repulsive excess of wealth immediately incurred the wrath of those who saw it. And, of course, it would: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/business/economy/unemployment-jobless-claims-coronavirus.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skyrocketed the rate of unemployment" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">skyrocketed the rate of unemployment</a> to an all-time high, as many as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/10/07/covid-19-to-add-as-many-as-150-million-extreme-poor-by-2021 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="150 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">150 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty</a> by 2021, more than <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="200,000 people have been killed" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">200,000 people have been killed</a> by the virus in the United States alone, and uprisings against anti-Blackness and systemic inequality continue to break out across the globe. All this to say, Kardashian West's affluence may not fix all these problems, but it certainly doesn't help. Its very existence, in fact, speaks to broader issues of economic inequality—a dynamic that typically sees certain echelons of society attaining glamor and luxury at the expense of working people.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, the Kardashian–Jenner clan are peddlers of outrage too. As they bask in the fumes of their latest scandal, I'm hoping that the workers who made her 40th birthday celebration possible were—at the very least—tipped well.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
