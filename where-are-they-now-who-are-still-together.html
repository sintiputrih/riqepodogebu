I love being outside, and I think that Austin has a lot of great places to do that. Austin is just great in every way. I thought I’d be here for 36 months and then move to another state since that’s what a travel nurse does. I’m not going anywhere, though.”</p><p>Zach went on, “What Kaity said, but with a lot more bbq. I didn’t get to see it because I was in California working on the show. Terry Black!
