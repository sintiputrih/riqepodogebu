He did not engage in any activity which resulted in injury to person or damage to property.”</p><p>“Forever” singer Brown, 23, Tweeted a photo of a deep cut on his chin after the incident, and wrote angrily, “How u party wit rich n**** that hate?

Although Drake seemed “irked” by Brown, he exited the club without exchanging words with Brown.</p><p>“Chris and Drake never got in each other’s faces,” the observer continues, explaining that another bystander threw a bottle at Brown — leading to his injuries. “It was entourage versus entourage, never Drake versus Chris.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>But, indeed, there was major melee. “It was lot of pushing and shoving.

The “We Found Love” singer has been secretly hooking up with volatile ex Brown for about a year — and is “good friends” with Drake, collaborating with him on the song and video for “Take Care.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadqpGgsm6wxKegnqtdlru6edarpqeflKS2r7OMoqVmm5intrR5waumsKZdm7aotNNmaWlpYmaBd3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chloe-rose-robertson.html><span>←</span><span>Chloe Rose Robertson Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth</span></a>
