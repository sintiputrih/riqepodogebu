So whether or not he will actually respond to his fans' texts is a mystery. It's not surprising that he will eventually be flooded with many missed calls, texts, and voicemails from fans or scam callers and pranksters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think This Dog Is Better Looking Than Jason Derulo, And His GF Agrees</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn660u81mm56qpaG8brbUrKtmn5mrsm6ywKeqZqCZqHqxtM6nnGampaKvpr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-leaked-unproduced-superhero-movie-scripts-check.html><span>←</span><span>5 Leaked/Unproduced Superhero Movie Scripts That You Need To Check Out</span></a>
