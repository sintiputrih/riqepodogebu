"We were wanna be rebels didn't have a clue..." You can hear the nostalgia in these lyrics, about reflecting back on an easier, uncertain, but definitely exciting time in his life. How he & his friends were pretty much everything (wild, crazy, etc.) but mostly young...we all need to occasionally take a trip down memory lane like this to enjoy the sentimental thoughts of our yesterdays. A time when we were too young to worry or care about much. Just enjoying life & hanging out with our friends, making the most of our youth, not thinking about tomorrow or caring much about any priorities or responsibilities. I think we all wish we could go back to a simpler time & this song does just that. Great tune if you're looking for some upbeat reflection style music.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZqSdnqPGbq%2FHnqqnnalkxrDBzaA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./friends-character-written-off-show-html.html><span>←</span><span>Hated Friends Character Written Off The Show For Not Being Funny</span></a>
