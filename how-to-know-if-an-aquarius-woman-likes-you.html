Not only will an <b>Aquarius woman</b> text <b>you when</b> she <b>misses you</b>, but she will go as far as sending <b>you</b> songs that remind her of <b>you</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-makes-an-aquarius-lose-interest></span>What makes an Aquarius lose interest?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Aquarius</b> men seem to <b>lose interest</b> rather fast when they feel like their heart is not into someone that excites them. <b>Aquarius</b> men have the tendency of wondering who they are meant to be with because they often feel like they are drawn to someone that understands them.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-aquarius-females-get-jealous></span>Do Aquarius females get jealous?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Aquarius women</b> are rarely <b>jealous</b> and possessive (and they hate <b>jealous</b>, possessive, insecure and demanding partners). This <b>woman</b> trusts her man completely and expects the same from him. Once committed, she will be a loyal and honest partner.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-aquarius-jealous-type></span>Are Aquarius jealous type?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>Aquarius</b> is a token of independence and camaraderie. They are not known for being <b>jealous</b>. They like being friends with people of all cultures and backgrounds, and they are always full of new ideas. As a matter of fact, <b>Aquarius</b> people don’t go through <b>jealousy</b> at all.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-aquarius-good-kissers></span>Are Aquarius good kissers?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Aquarius</b>. Kissing an <b>Aquarius</b> is an experience like no other.

Bouts of <b>possessiveness</b> are highly uncharacteristic for the <b>Aquarian</b> man. He loves freedom and wants his partner to feel free as well.
