Quite simply, we all know he's one of the best live television broadcasters this country has ever had and we and all the team wish him all the best."</p><p id=e1QBzfSr3mu data-wc=34>Dermot added: "As a show, everyone on and off screen want to say a huge thank you to Phil for what he's done to make the show a success over the last 21 years."</p><p id=e5_kMwaADN data-wc=14><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Phillip Schofield could be moving over to this popular BBC show – details</a></strong></p><p id=e7Ju7jbeTbJ data-wc=13><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Phil Schofield’s feuds over the years: Eamonn Holmes, Amanda Holden, Fern Britton</a></p><p id=eTm6Y9iaThI data-wc=65>Others have come to the star's defence, including his co-star, Rochelle Humes.
