He was one of the people I rely on the most, he was always there for advice.</p><p>"What happened with him and his daughter passing hurt me deeply. The number 24 is the jersey he wore when he became a legend of basketball. It was a symbolic thing to acknowledge him for all the things he’s done.”</p><p>The match hinged on a marathon second set lasting 104 minutes, which was longer than both players' entire first-round matches.</p><p>Djokovic won it after a tie-break to move 2-0 up and finally break Medvedev's spirit, going on to gain a measure of revenge after the Russian denied him the calendar grand slam in the final here two years ago.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Sport</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/09/us-actor-matthew-mcconaughey-gestures-844056908.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/09/novak-djokovic-serbia-celebrates-american-844069174.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/09/emily-ratajkowski-justin-theroux-seen-844091510.jpg><p>The win also moved him level with Court's record of major titles, although really that is a statistical irrelevance given the obvious difference in the level and depth of competition between now and the 1960s.</p><p>Of more importance to Djokovic is his record against his peers; he is now two clear of Rafael Nadal's 22 grand slam crowns and four ahead of Roger Federer, who declared on 20 last year.</p><p>Having already won in Australia and Paris, Djokovic has picked up three major titles in a year for the fourth time in his career. Only the five-set defeat by Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final blemished his 2023 record.</p><p>Now he has surpassed Ken Rosewall, who was 35 when he won in 1970, and who did not have to contend with any sets lasting almost an hour and a quarter.</p><p>Djokovic, who missed last year's championships due to his vaccine status, wore a tracksuit top adorned with the number 24 - which presumably would not have seen the light of day had he lost - for the trophy presentation.</p><p>He said: "I don't know where to start, it obviously means the world to me. I'm really living my childhood dream to compete at the highest level in a sport that has given me and my family so much.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/09/champion-novak-djokovic-serbia-interviewed-844069690.jpg><p>"I never imagined I would be standing here talking about 24 slams. But the last couple of years I felt I had a chance, a shot at history, so why not grab it?"</p><p>A Medvedev double-fault and a blistering backhand winner down the line gave Djokovic the early break point which he converted to love to subsequently take the first set in a relatively speedy 48 minutes.</p><p>But Medvedev, returning from about a quarter-of-a-mile behind the baseline, made Djokovic toil in the second set and it began to show with the favourite showing signs of fatigue.</p><p>After an hour and three quarters he produced his first break point of the match but Djokovic, with an obvious change of game plan in a bid to shorten the points, expertly snuffed it out with a big serve and an immaculate volley.</p><p>Medvedev had set point on the Djokovic serve but another volley at the net dealt with that, and when tie-break slipped away from the 27-year-old, the match soon followed.</p><p>The runner-up joked: "First of all I want to ask Novak what are you still doing here? I mean come on.</p><p>"I don't know when you are planning to slow down a little bit. I feel like I have a good career, I have 20 titles, but you have 24 grand slams. Wow!"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on talkSPORT">Read More on talkSPORT</h2><p>Not one to hint at retirement, Djokovic joked in his post-match press conference: “Players come and go. It’ll be the same kind of destiny for me. Eventually, one day, I’ll leave tennis in about 23 or 24 years.”</p><p>The newcomers have been warned...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraKyVo7uqv45qbG9qYGyAcLrOr5ikZZSfvKy71aKaZpuVobKjvsCtnKxlp57BqXnMmqutoJWseq6vwqilmq2XnbK6ecCnm2aoka7AbsDRopmurJViwbB5wauwmqakYq60eceeZKaZm5rAbrTIrKuoqqlixKrAx2asrGWfpbKvedOroK6loJ18</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deletes-scenes-from-a-film-for-example-html.html><span>←</span><span>Deletes scenes from a film for example</span></a>
