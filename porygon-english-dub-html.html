He was working at a syndication company and I had worked with him on a few different projects over the years and we had stayed in touch and became friends. He knew I was working on a direct-to-video series called Slayers, adapting the scripts and casting the actors and directing the actors. And so he called me and he said 'I think I may have a job for you.' And he described a series that his company 4Kids was syndicating. He said it was about these kids who captured these little monsters, and then the monsters would fight. And I said hey, is this the series that's been in the news that sent all the kids to the hospital in Japan? And he said 'Yeah, but we're not gonna show that episode.'"</td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><span></span><span></span><span><br>On January 19th, Summit Media started shopping 4Kids' new "Pokémon" show to potential networks.

The sales team took the animated series with them to NATPE (pronounced "Nappy"), a video contents convention held in New Orleans on January 19th, 1998. Animation is a big seller at this convention, you know. The goal was to sell 'Pokémon' to each syndication network, one by one, until the show was airing on enough networks to cover at least 90% of the country.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span><br></span><span>The trade show is covered in this <a href=#>Animation World Network report</a> from February 1st, 1998.

Summit is currently syndicating a slate of programming that includes Mr. Men, MGM Productions' Robocop: Alpha Commando and Pokémon. <span>Hirsch was quick to explain that the offending Pokémon scene which caused a number of seizures in Japan in December had been cut.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><span></span><span><span><br>Summit Media's stance of not airing the Porygon episode as-is, at the very least least, is repeated in the "Full Report" TV-Tokyo wrote up in the wake of the incident.

In response, Shogakukan Productions had this to say about selling the program abroad: “TV-Tokyo's mind is made up, and until we reach certain decisions we will not be selling over all the rights. The party we're currently in negotiations with is adhering to these basic rules that've been laid out.” As far as Summit is concerned, they're not willing to air Pokémon until they can guarantee it's safe to air and have also said they've decided they'll be removing Episode 38 from the lineup entirely."

The English dub voice is noticeably deeper and more robotic sounding than the comparatively high pitched voice heard in the Japanese version.<p>Generally speaking 4Kids would keep Pokémon voices the same between versions if their names weren't changed during the localization process, though as with everything else Pokémon there are a <span>ton</span> of exceptions to this. Was Porygon's voice change here just another example of one of 4Kids' random recasts? Or, did 4Kids change the voice because they didn't have access to Episode 038 or any of its audio and therefore had no choice but to come up with a brand new one? You could make arguments either way.<br></p></span><span></span><span><span><span></span></span><br><span><span>Budget</span></span><br></span><span>The big thing I often see missing in these types of discussions is the logistics of actually producing a dub of "Cyber Soldier Porygon." Where would 4Kids have gotten the money to actually dub the episode? The amount it takes to dub an episode of anime can vary greatly from series to series, year to year, and concrete numbers are surprisingly difficult to come by. The only well sourced figure I was able to find was t</span>he <a href=#>Skip Beat! Kickstarter</a>, which hoped to raise $155,000 to dub 25 episodes. That's around $6,200 an episode, though it's also worth mentioning that this amount does not cover the huge cost that is the show's licensing fees. Other estimates often cited online put the average cost closer to $10,000 per episode.<p><span>We don't have any hard numbers for how much it cost to dub a single episode of </span><span>Pokémon</span><span> back in 1998, but one thing is for sure; it would not have been a non-neglible amount, <span>especially</span> for a TV show just starting out. Remember, in 1998 there was absolutely no guarantee that this "Pokémon" thing wouldn't end up being a massive flop in the West. It's unlikely 4Kids would have had the extra 10Gs lying around to dub an episode they had no chance of ever airing.<br><span><span></span></span></span><span><span><span></span></span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span><br></span></p><table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2><tbody readability=1><tr readability=2><td><span>So does an English dub exist?</span><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><span readability=1.9261213720317><br><span readability=3.8522427440633>Based on <span>everything</span> above -- the timeline of events, the voice actor comments, the other elements at play -- I would have to conclude that no, an English dub does not exist.<p>If you look at the way events unfolded after December 16th it's very clear how serious everyone was taking the Pokémon Shock incident.

Eric Stuart more or less backpedaled on his 2016 comments when confronted about them in 2022, going from</p></span></span><span>"I remember dubbing it" to "No, I think I only saw it in the studio." But even his 2016 comments, on their own, aren't altogether convincing. The flippant way he says "Yeah. Sure. Sure we did" gives off the vibe of someone telling a kid whatever they wanna hear to get them to finally shut the hell up, and his "How else would I have seen it?" comment doesn't make sense either when paired with his conversation about "The Legend of Miniryu"&nbsp;</span><span readability=20.650862068966><a href=#>at the very same convention</a>. So Mr. Stuart knows about "The Legend of Miniryu" even though 4Kids never dubbed it, but he only knows about "Cyber Soldier Porygon" <span>because</span> 4Kids <span></span>dubbed it? He's contradicting himself.<p>The Maddie Blaustein comment, in a vacuum, would usually be enough proof for most people. But given the mountain of evidence to the contrary it kind of keeps losing its efficacy.</p><p>In the case of both Maddie Blaustein and Eric Stuart, I don't think either one of them <span>lied</span>, at least not intentionally. I think it's much more likely they simply either mis-remembered what happened or got the episode mixed up with something else. "Cyber Soldier Porygon" was <span>old</span> when these actors were asked about them (nine years when Ms. Blaustein was asked about it in 2006 and nineteen when Eric Stuart talked about it in 2016) and they had done hundreds, if not thousands, of episodes of television by that point in time. I don't think it's weird or inappropriate to suggest they were inadvertently mixing things up when they made their comments.</p><p>On the other hand, it's also possible actors like Veronica Taylor and Rachel Lillis are the ones mis-remembering what happened. They even admit as much in their respective comments. I've also seen some people claim Veronica Taylor is "backpedaling" in the video interview linked to above but I see her reticence to be less about her second guessing herself and more her not wanting to throw her colleague Eric Stuart under the bus. Showing professional courtesy and grace toward a former colleague by refusing to call him a liar is not the same thing as "backpedaling," now is it?<br></p></span><span readability=4><span readability=8><br>So what else is there? Well, there's the question of who would have paid for a hypothetical dub of the episode to be made, a major factor that we don't even have anything close to an answer for.<p>At this point, I think it's safe to say that all the evidence tells us that it's extremely, extremely unlikely that an English dub of "Cyber Soldier Porygon" ever existed. If any new evidence comes out that might change, but at this point? I think anything less than a full leak of the 4Kids dub episode itself is unlikely to be convincing.<br></p></span></span><span><br></span><span></span> <span></span> <span><br></span><span></span> <span></span><span></span></td><td><br></td><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmicn5yutMGNm6ylmpGcrrOwxKdlp52kZLmmrdGnZqutnaS%2FoLPUopueZ6Ckv7qzzqeWnqaXoba0tL6drJtmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./monica-ruiz-wiki-biography-age-height-weight-peloton-wife-dating-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Monica Ruiz Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Peloton Wife, Dating, Husband</span></a>
