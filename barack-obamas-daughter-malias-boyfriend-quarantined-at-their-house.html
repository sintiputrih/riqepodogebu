The only thing you discover — [and] this is not a surprise to you, Bill, because you’ve got a son — young men eat. It’s weird to watch them consume food. My grocery bill went up about 30 percent.”</p><p>The Hawaii native also shares <a href=#>Sasha</a>, 19, with his wife, <a href=#><strong>Michelle Obama</strong></a>, and the Becoming author, 56, joked in September that <a href=#>their daughters were “sick” of them</a> during lockdown.</p><p>“[It] was fine because we were pretty much sick of them,” the attorney joked during a Conan appearance at the time. “The summer started happening, and then we could be outside a little bit more. We came to the vineyard, where we still are, and so there’s more room to roam around. That was good because it helped us break it up.”</p><p>Her family members were “all organized” in the beginning of the COVID-19 spread, the Chicago native added. “The girls were still in classes in the spring, and so we would be working and then doing a little exercise, and then come together in the evenings. And we would have these activities. We would have cocktails, and then we would work on puzzles and play games.”</p><p>Their quarantine experience included playing Spades and doing watercolor paintings.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Dreams From My Father author had “limited time to get on [his wife’s] nerves,” while working on his new book, The Promised Land, Michelle said — but during “tough times” in their relationship, the Princeton University grad has previously wanted to <a href=#>“push” her husband out a window</a>.</p><p>“The feelings will be intense,” Michelle said during a September 2020 “Michelle Obama Podcast” episode of the ups and downs of marriage. “But that doesn’t mean you quit. And these periods can last a long time. They can last years. … If I had given up on it, if I had walked away from it in those tough times, then I would’ve missed all the beauty that was there as well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabmaKWsKx5zpuYppmjYrGiwcahq56qXaKurbXArGSbp6mbv6qxzZ1kqq2Rp66vwMinnJ1lkal6tbTEoqlmoJ%2BqwKZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./austin-scott.html><span>←</span><span>Austin Scott</span></a>
