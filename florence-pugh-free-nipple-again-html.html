As we have previously <a href=#>reported</a>, Florence Pugh is completely unafraid to reveal her body in various daring outfits and these images from a Twitter fan account only reinforce that. The pictures are outtakes from a photo shoot with legendary jewelry company <a href=#>Tiffany & Co.</a>, but we are a little more focused on Florence Pugh than the jewels.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>As one can see above, Florence Pugh is posing underneath lamps (notably, not actual Tiffany lamps) with a certain body feature exposed through the lacy halter top of her outfit. These photos appear to be from the Vision & Virtuosity exhibition by Tiffany & Co., held at the Saatchi Gallery in London. Her full outfit included the black halter top seen above, a long matching lace skirt that left her midriff bare, and sheer nylon opera gloves, all complemented with an ornate Tiffany bracelet and a necklace.&nbsp;</p><p>At just 26 years old, Florence Pugh has already established herself as one of the biggest box-office draws in the world, a universally praised dramatic actor, and a consummate fashion plate. Whether she is wearing a ridiculously <a href=#>enormous tulle cape</a> by Rodarte or a two-tone 1960s <a href=#>Mod outfit</a>, Pugh is definitely one of the most stylish actresses of her entire generation. Unfortunately, that has come with the predictable (and unfair) amount of <a href=#>body-shaming</a> as you might expect, but we are definitely glad to see that Florence Pugh is unafraid to be wearing what she wants.&nbsp;</p><p>Most recently, Florence Pugh starred in the Netflix period piece film The Wonder, in which she played a young English nurse in the 19th century who comes to Ireland to examine a girl who appears to be able to live indefinitely without consuming food, which some consider to be a heavenly miracle. The Wonder was adapted from a 2016 novel by Emma Donoghue and has largely received positive reviews.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/florence-pugh-dont-worry-darling-900x506.jpg><p>Florence Pugh also starred in the much more publicized Don’t Worry Darling in 2022, a science fiction thriller directed by Olivia Wilde (who also co-starred). Though the movie was eventually released to mostly respectable reviews and unexpectedly large grosses, it will most likely go down in history more for the gossip that surrounded the production. Between the romance between Olivia Wilde and co-star Harry Styles, rumors of on-set fights between Pugh and Wilde, rebuttals of the rumors by crewmembers, and the lead actress doing almost no press for the film, Don’t Worry Darling briefly became a hot topic in entertainment.</p><p><br>However, Florence Pugh already has a number of huge projects lined up. She will be starring in the upcoming Dune: Part Two as Princess Irulan, daughter of the Emperor of the Known Universe (played by Christopher Walken, naturally), and reprising the role of Yelena Belova in Thunderbolts. The latter film reportedly has netted her a huge paycheck and a lead role in the biggest franchise on the planet, and we say she deserves both.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnlqG8s7HNnJxmqKWctW6y0Z6cZqaZpb2tsYyanpqhnmO1tbnL</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reed-cross-howard-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-592874-html.html><span>←</span><span>Reed Cross Howard Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
