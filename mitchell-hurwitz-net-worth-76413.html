In 1976, when Hurwitz was 12, he co-founded a chocolate-chip cookie <a href=#>Business</a>, called the Chipyard, with his older brother, Michael, and his father, Mark. The Chipyard is still in operation in Boston. He graduated from Estancia High School in Costa Mesa, CA, and from Georgetown University in 1985 with a double major in <a href=#>English</a> and Theology.</p><span>1980</span><p>Hurwitz worked on several sitcoms in the 1980s and 1990s, including <i>Nurses</i>, <i>The Golden Girls</i>, <i>The Golden Palace</i>, <i>The John Larroquette Show</i>, <i>The Ellen Show</i> and the Michael J. Fox-produced pilot <i>Hench at Home</i>. He also created <i>Everything's Relative</i>, a midseason comedy starring Jeffrey Tambor and Jill Clayburgh for NBC in 1999.</p><span>2000</span><p>Hurwitz is married to <a href=#>Actress</a> Mary Jo Keenen. They have two daughters: May Asami, born in 2000, and Phoebe Hitomi born in 2002. The name of <i>Arrested Development</i> character "Maeby" was the result of combining the names of Hurwitz's daughters.</p><span>2002</span><p>Hurwitz was chosen by Ron Howard to create a sitcom about a rich dysfunctional family, which eventually turned into <i>Arrested Development</i>. Hurwitz wrote the pilot in 2002, which was filmed in March 2003. Fox added the show to its schedule in May. Although the show premiered to stunning reviews from television critics around the country, the show was plagued by low ratings throughout its three-season run. In July 2004, the show was nominated for 7 Primetime Emmy Awards and won 5, including Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series.</p><span>2007</span><p>Among Hurwitz's projects have been the US television adaptations of the <a href=#>British</a> comedy shows <i>The Thick of It</i> (which was not picked up in the running for ABC's 2007–2008 TV season, though other networks such as HBO, Showtime and NBC have expressed interest) and <i>Absolutely Fabulous</i>.</p><span>2008</span><p>Hurwitz created Fox's animated comedy <i>Sit Down, Shut Up</i>, based on an <a href=#>Australian</a> TV series of the same name, for the 2008 season.</p><span>2009</span><p><i>My World And Welcome To It</i> was a 2009 CBS television pilot, executive produced by Hurwitz, Jay Kogen, Kim Tannenbaum, and Barry Sonnenfeld. It was a comedy based on an earlier series <i>My World and Welcome to It</i> about being a dad in the 1960s which, in turn, drew material from James Thurber's collection of essays of the same name. <i>Happiness Isn't Everything</i> was also a 2009 CBS pilot, written by Hurwitz and Jim Vallely, starring <a href=#>Richard Dreyfus</a>s, Jason Biggs, Ben Schwartz and Mary Steenburgen.</p><span>2010</span><p>Hurwitz created <i>Running Wilde</i>, which aired for one season from 2010 to 2011. It was a collaboration with <i>Arrested Development</i> star Will Arnett.</p><span>2013</span><p>After seven years off the air, <i>Arrested Development</i> returned for a fifteen-episode fourth season on the online movie and television streaming <a href=#>Service</a> Netflix on May 26, 2013.</p><span>2014</span><p>Hurwitz starred as "Koogler" in the <i>Community</i> episode "App Development and Condiments" (episode 8, season 5), which aired on March 6, 2014. He reprised that role in "Modern Espionage" (episode 11, season 6), which aired on May 19, 2015.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>American television writers</a> <a href=#>Male television writers</a> <a href=#>Primetime Emmy Award winners</a> <a href=#>Jewish American writers</a> <a href=#>Georgetown University alumni</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>American television producers</a> <a href=#>1963 births</a> <a href=#>People from Amarillo, Texas</a> <a href=#>People from Anaheim, California</a> <a href=#>Showrunners</a> <a href=#>Writers Guild of America Award winners</a> <a href=#>American television directors</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmednsGktMSlo2agpafEqsDZZqWerF2svLPAx2Zub2xhaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maverick-mcneilly-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-643346-html.html><span>←</span><span>Maverick McNeilly Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
