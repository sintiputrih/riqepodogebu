Coppola says we are. So I guess we’re married under the eyes of God.”</p><p dir=ltr><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Is-Keanu-Reeves-Married-The-Truth-About-His-Relationship-With-Winona-Ryder-Is-Finally-Revealed-1.jpg></p><p dir=ltr>Keanu isn’t the only one who believes the wedding in the film was actually real. Winona echoed the sentiment that the pair are married in a 2018 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=2>Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>​​“We actually got married in&nbsp;Dracula,” the&nbsp;Stranger Things&nbsp;actress said. “No, I swear to God I think we’re married in real life. In that scene, Francis [Ford Coppola] used a real Romanian priest. We shot the master and he did the whole thing. So I think we’re married.”</p><p dir=ltr>The duo never actually signed any official marriage documents. Keanu and Winona have been friends for more than 30 years. The pair first met in 1987 at the Independent Spirit Awards at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel when they presented an award together. They had several mutual friends and continued to hang out in a group. Francis chose Winona to star in&nbsp;Dracula&nbsp;and asked for her advice on who to cast as her love interest. She suggested Keanu for the part which ultimately led to the now-famous wedding scene.</p><p dir=ltr>“This is pretty authentic and I think very beautiful because we actually did the ceremony and had the priest do the ceremony,” Francis told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=3>The Guardian</a>&nbsp;in 2018. “So in a sense, when we were all done, we realized that Keanu and Winona really are married as a result of this scene and this ceremony.”</p><p dir=ltr>Winona and Keanu admitted to having “healthy crushes” on each other in an August 2018 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=4>Entertainment Tonight</a>. This isn’t the first famous costar that Keanu has had a crush on. He shared on&nbsp;<a href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>&nbsp;in 2019 that he had a crush on&nbsp;<a href=#>Speed</a>&nbsp;costar&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Sandra Bullock</strong></a>.</p><p dir=ltr><i>Dracula</i> is just one of the films that Winona and Keanu have starred in together. In 2006, they shared the screen in A Scanner Darkly. They worked together again in 2009’s The Private Lives of Pippa Lee and 2018’s Destination Wedding. Despite all of the marriage talk, neither Keanu nor Winona have ever been legally married.</p><p dir=ltr>Winona has been dating fashion maven&nbsp;<strong>Scott Mackinlay Hahn&nbsp;</strong>since 2011. They’ve kept their relationship under wraps for over a decade. Keanu has been dating artist&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Alexandra Grant</strong></a>. The couple first met in 2009 at a dinner party before making their red carpet debut as a couple in 2019. Even though Keanu and Winona are in relationships with other people, their friendship will last a lifetime.</p><p>“I’ve been so lucky in my life that I’ve worked with so many great actors but there is something very, very special with Keanu,” the Golden Globe winner shared in a 2018 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=5>iHollywoodTV</a>. “I have so much love and respect for him and it really genuinely makes going to work and working an absolute pleasure.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46iqmajlZa7tnnRnpyvnaNiuqK%2B0aKcnWWknbJuwNGuq6FlkZe8tsCMoaCsZaeasaW1zaBkraddrLavu82aZKuxlJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./recipe-index-root.html><span>←</span><span>How to Press Tofu</span></a>
