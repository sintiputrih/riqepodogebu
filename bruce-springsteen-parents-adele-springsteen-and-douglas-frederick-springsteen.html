In Freehold, New Jersey, he was raised Catholic. Adele Ann was his mother, and she was a native of Brooklyn’s Bay Ridge. She was the family’s primary provider and worked as a legal secretary.</p><p>Douglas Frederick “Dutch” Springsteen, who lived from 1924 until 1998, held a variety of vocations, including bus driver. Throughout his life, his father struggled with mental health concerns, which grew worse as he aged. Virginia and Pamela, two younger sisters of Springsteen, were born in or around 1962.</p><p>Vico Equense was the birthplace of Springsteen’s Italian maternal grandfather, who immigrated from Italy via Ellis Island. When he first arrived, he was unable to read or write.</p><p>He later went on to become a lawyer and left a “larger than life” impression on the young Springsteen. The topographic surname Springsteen, which literally means “jump stone” and refers to a stepping stone used on unpaved streets or between two houses, has its origins in the Dutch area of Groningen. In the 1600s, the Springsteen were one of the first Dutch families to arrive in the colony of New Netherland.</p><p>Springsteen started attending the public Freehold High School in the ninth grade, although he struggled to fit in there as well. He was described as a “loner who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar” by a former teacher. He received his diploma in 1967, but he skipped the celebration because he felt so out of place.[20] He attended Ocean County College for a short while before leaving.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>When he was 19 years old and called up for the draft, Springsteen failed the physical and opted not to serve in the Vietnam War because of a concussion he had sustained in a motorcycle accident two years before and his actions at induction, which supposedly declared him unfit for duty. Springsteen’s parents and sister Pamela moved to San Mateo, California in 1969, when he was 20 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-are-bruce-springsteen-parents><strong>Who are Bruce Springsteen parents?</strong></h2><p>Bruce Springsteen’s parents are Adele Springsteen and Douglas Frederick Springsteen.
