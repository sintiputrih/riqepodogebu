You <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">can read our review here</a>, but below is the full rundown from other sites and the Metacritic rating for all platforms.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>On PlayStation 5, Metacritic has rated the game at 86, on Xbox Series S|X 86 too, and on PC it’s at 83.</p><p data-characters=44 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>Here are some of the most prominent reviews:</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>IGN gives it a 90: “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Launch performance issues aside, it’s a sequel that does virtually everything better than the original – which was already an exceptional Star Wars game.</a>“</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>VGC gives it full marks, dubbing it “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A thrilling adventure with a stellar cast tied together with smart, expansive combat, and huge new worlds to explore.</a>“</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>Gamespot gives it an 80, saying it’s “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a superb Star Wars game that gets into the nitty-gritty of the struggle of what it takes for a Jedi Knight to begin the journey toward the rank of Master.</a>” but admits “Survivor’s technical performance is a stumbling block that must be noted.”</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=116 data-injectable=false>Gamereactor UK says “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the gameplay is simply an improvement of Fallen Order’s outstanding formula.</a>“</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>XboxEra says “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Performance during my review was rough, but if they can smooth it out then this is a game that no one should miss.</a>“</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>Eurogamer is more measured, not giving it a recommended and saying: “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The technical issues are less catastrophic, although things can still get pretty rough at the seams – think hands, hair, and various items regularly clipping through surfaces, and some frantic pop-in and cloak-flapping when coming in and out of cutscenes.</a>“</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>TheGamer says: “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">There are performance issues too, with some odd blurring during movement, stuttering even in Performance mode, and bugs throughout, while I had two hard crashes on PS5.</a>“</p><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=707 data-injectable=true>The consensus seems to be that Survivor is a fine sequel, with some notable technical issues. The improved gameplay and combat are picking up a lot of praise, as is the compelling story, writing and acting. But bubbling under that is a swathe of polish issues that tarnish the game. We go into them in depth in our review, though clearly, some critics are able to overlook performance issues and glitches and praise the game for what it probably will be after a few weeks of patches rather than what it is now.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>Either way, it’s looking like Survivor is set to have a somewhat bumpy launch across all platforms as Respawn squashes bugs and improves performance. Once again, day-one purchasers are getting a subpar experience and we suspect there’s going to be some rather disappointed gamers taking to social media come launch day on Friday unless a day-one patch is ready to ship ASAP.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoq6GdXajBor6MsJirq12fsqW1jKysq66Zq7yzedGeraKdp2LApLvRnqpmmZ6Zeq6x05qaq6GknrBuvsCtoKefXZa%2FpnnHnqmeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./107724-meek-mills-lawyers-say-judge-genece-brinkley-should-resign-due-to-maid-trauma-news.html><span>←</span><span>Meek Mill's Lawyers Say Judge Genece Brinkley Should Resign Due To &amp;quot;Maid Trauma&amp;quot;</span></a>
