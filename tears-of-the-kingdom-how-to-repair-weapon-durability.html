But these fears can be put at ease thanks to this simple mechanic.</p><ul><li><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tears of the Kingdom – Do Weapons Respawn?</a></li></ul><h2>How to Increase Weapon Durability in TotK</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/totk-rock-octorok-locations.jpg><p>To pull this repair off, players need two things: a weapon and <strong>a Rock Octorok</strong>. The Rock Octoroks are the grey Octoroks that suck in air and spit out fireballs found <strong>around Death Mountain</strong>. The map above shows the exact location of five Rock Octoroks.</p><p>Here’s how to get the Rock Octorok to repair your melee weapon, shield, or bow:</p><ul data-injection=true><li>Locate a Rock Octorok around Death Mountain</li><li>Drop the piece of gear you want to repair on the ground</li><li>Use Ultrahand if needed to move the weapon closer to the Octorok’s mouth</li><li>Wait for the Octorok to suck up the item</li><li>If the Octorok sparkles, the weapon’s durability has been fully restored, and a random perk has been added</li><li>Dodge or catch the piece of gear when it is spit out.</li></ul><p><strong>Note: Each Rock Octorok can only repair one item per Blood Moon cycle</strong>. After replenishing a weapon’s durability, kill the Octorok and move on to the next. The Octorok will reappear after the next Blood Moon allowing for another repair.</p><p data-injection=true>Players can also use this method to reroll the perk on their weapon. However, we recommend saving in front of the Octorok before offering it a weapon as you can reload the game if the perk isn’t up to your standard.</p><p>And that’s it!
