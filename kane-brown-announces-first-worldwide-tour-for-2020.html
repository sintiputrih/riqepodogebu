The leading vocalist’s latest collaboration, the “brutally catchy” (Rolling Stone) “One Thing Right” with internationally renowned DJ/producer Marshmello has already amassed nearly 400 million streams worldwide, and can be found&nbsp;<a href=#>HERE</a>. In addition to&nbsp;Brown’s vocal highlighted on the track, which “shines with his deep twang that is both warm and dangerous,” (Rolling Stone) he also co-wrote “One Thing Right.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Noted as being the “future of Country” (Billboard) and one of “31 People Changing the South” (Time),&nbsp;Brown&nbsp;released his sophomore&nbsp;Experiment&nbsp;in November 2018, which debuted #1 on both the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;200 and Top Country Albums chart. With&nbsp;Experiment,&nbsp;Brown&nbsp;became the only male country artist in more than 24 years to debut at the top of the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;200, and only one of three country artists to top the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;200 chart in all of 2018. To date,&nbsp;Experiment&nbsp;has produced back-to-back #1 hits–the Platinum-certified singles,&nbsp;“Lose&nbsp;It” and “Good As You,”–&nbsp;and was ranked by&nbsp;The New York Times&nbsp;as one of the Top 10 Best Albums of the Year. An ACM, AMA, Billboard and CMT Music Awards nominee,&nbsp;Brown&nbsp;first broke through the country charts with his debut self-titled album, which debuted #1 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Top Country Album charts and spent a record-breaking 13 weeks at the top of the chart.&nbsp;Brown&nbsp;is the first artist in&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;history to Top all 5&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Country charts simultaneously and with the 4X Platinum certifications of “Heaven” and “What Ifs,” he is one of only five country acts with multiple 4X Platinum hits (joining Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Sam Hunt and Taylor Swift.)</p><p>With “crowd-pleasing original tunes and the voice to make them memorable” (The Roanoke Times),&nbsp;Brown&nbsp;is “not your typical every day act,” and has earned praise as “the boundary-defying future of country music,” (Atlanta Journal Constitution)&nbsp;and “one of the genre’s biggest and most unique artists” (The Commercial Appeal). The arena headliner who puts on “an extraordinarily ebullient concert” (Kansas City Star) continues to earn praise and break concert records with his sold-out live performances, including a recent record at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo for most fans in attendance for a country act and with his recent headlining Staples Center show, which sold out in less than two hours.</p><p>Live Nation is the official US tour promoter and Citi is the official pre-sale credit card of the Worldwide Beautiful Tour.

Dickerson’s debut album charted at no. 5 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, arriving at no. 1 on Billboard’s Emerging Artists chart and garnered his ACM nominations for “Song of the Year,” “New Male Vocalist of the Year,” and CMT nomination for “Breakthrough Video of the Year.” He was also nominated for an iHeart Radio Music Award for “Best New County Artist.” With a profound dedication to breeding authentic human connection, People Magazine’s “One to Watch” and festival fan favorite spends as much time on the road with the fans who made “Yours” the undisputed wedding song of 2018. Hot off Thomas Rhett’s Very Hot Summer Tour, Dickerson will join&nbsp;Kane&nbsp;Brown&nbsp;on the Worldwide Beautiful Tour this Spring 2020, which follows his national co-headlining tour with Carly Pearce earlier this year.
