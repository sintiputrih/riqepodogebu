There are photos of her hugging a friend and smiling with her mom, clearly enjoying this big event. In some pictures, Suri holds her cap in one hand as she walks in heels with her gown open to reveal her white dress underneath. The Dawson’s Creek alum wore light yellow pleated pants and a matching collared shirt for the occasion. <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-953238490-1.jpg alt="HOLLYWOOD, CA - APRIL 26: Bindi Irwin attends the ceremony honoring Steve Irwin with star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 26, 2018 in Hollywood, California.

Last month, she reportedly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">also used “Suri Noelle”</a> when she acted in a local theater company’s performance. Whether or not she will legally drop his name <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">like 18-year-old Shiloh Jolie</a> remains to be seen.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Insiders told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> in April that Suri hasn’t seen her dad in six years. “Katie has safeguarded Suri and she’s a devoted mom,” they shared.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The same month, former leading Scientologist Karen De La Carriere told<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> DailyMail</a> that the church may be prohibiting Tom from seeing his daughter. “Katie was deemed a Suppressive Person and Suri, by extension, Potential Trouble Source,” she said. These are terms used by Scientology to describe people who are potentially enemies of the Church.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Tom cannot engage or connect with his own daughter. In Scientology, it is Scientology first; family priorities come low down in the order,” she explained. <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-953238490-1.jpg alt="HOLLYWOOD, CA - APRIL 26: Bindi Irwin attends the ceremony honoring Steve Irwin with star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 26, 2018 in Hollywood, California.

I’m sure his master plan is to wait until Suri gets older so that he can lure her into Scientology and away from her mother.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">If that truly was his plan, it does not seem to be working as Suri is clearly removing him from her life and name. For his part, the Top Gun star doesn’t seem to be too worried about it. He spent the weekend dancing to “Shake It Off” and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bonding with Travis Kelce</a> at one of Taylor Swift’s London performances on the Eras Tour. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Before you go, check out <a href=# rel=noopener>these celebrity parents</a> these who pay more in monthly child support than most people make annually.</strong><br><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blank-1440-x-1080-2-2.png alt width=1024 height=768 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jqmYq52eqbavs46aqa2hk6GytHuSaWtybWZqfKyt06KcZqCfobqmv4ydmK6fmKmys3nSrqmiZZSnvLG8xJ1kraedYrCzwcisnGamkaKycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./if-those-deadpool-3-rumors-are-true-here-are-the-5-deadpool-variants-we-want-to-see.html><span>←</span><span>If those Deadpool 3 rumors are true, here are the 5 Deadpool variants we want to see</span></a>
