Frank Zappa obtained his net worth by directing films, and producing more than 60 albums. Born Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940 – December 4, 1993) in Baltimore, Maryland, he was an unprecedented rock musician, world-widely known for his terrific musical knowledge and outrageous sense of humor. In his more than a three-decade-long career, Zappa composed atypical works ranging from rock and jazz to orchestral and musique concrète musical pieces. He was only a teenage boy when he acquired a taste and appreciation for 20th-century classical composers like Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky and Anton Webern, along with 1950s rhythm and blues music. He started writing classical music while in high school and at the same time he was playing drums in rhythm and blues bands. Later on, Zappa switched to playing the electric guitar. All in all, he has produced more than 60 albums, some together with the band The Mothers of Invention and others as a solo artist. His 1966 debut album with The Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, was created using an eclectic and experimental musical approach along with foul and funny lyrics, just like the most of the subsequent compositions with the band. As for Zappa’s solo albums like Weasels Ripped My Flesh, Apostrophe and Shut Up ‘N Play Yer Guitar, they only helped him turn from an underground rock star to a highly regarded composer. A self-taught composer as he was and influenced by various types of music, Frank created tunes that critics often found difficult to categorize. In addition to his vast musical opus, he was a loud critic of mainstream education and organized religion, as well as a passionate advocate for freedom of speech, self-education, political participation and abolition of censorship. He got married twice in his life and with his second wife he had four children, Moon, Dweezil, Ahmet and Diva. Frank Zappa was posthumously honored as he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and granted the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ6ilrusedmap6mZo2K7psCMsKarrJhir6q7xquYqaCpYrOir9NmmpqqlZq%2Fbq3Wmqmdq12Wu6V5y6KdnmWjqbyzxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-kenney-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Kenney: 25 Things You Dont Know About Me</span></a>
