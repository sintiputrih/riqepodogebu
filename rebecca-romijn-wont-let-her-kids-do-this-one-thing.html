My kids are nagging me about it because of lot of their friends already have them. … [Those parents] are ruining it for the rest of us.”</p><p>The X-Men star said that between her and husband <a href=#><strong>Jerry O’Connell</strong></a>, she tends to be the more strict parent. “I’m probably more of a disciplinarian than my husband,” she admitted to Us.</p><p>Even so, the Ugly Betty alum loves spending time with her growing girls. “They’re sassy. They just turned 10, double digits. It’s exciting. … The more developed they become, the more I enjoy them. They’re great human beings. I really enjoy my time with them.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Romijn previously spoke about her preteens to Us in July 2018, revealing that they have <a href=#>felt more grown-up since getting their own rooms</a>. “Like, all of a sudden, they’re more important than they used to be,” she said. “They feel like they’re all high and mighty. They’re acting like teenagers already.”</p><p>The actress and the Scream 2 star, 44, tied the knot in July 2007 and <a href=#>welcomed their children</a> in December 2008.</p><p>With reporting by Nicki Gostin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarnZKasKStjKumpqGao3q4u82tZKWdpGK1pr6MpKCdq12ZvG7Ax6KqZqeemnq1tMinnmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pic-amanda-seyfried-holds-hands-with-new-boyfriend-desmond-harrington-2012278.html><span>←</span><span>PIC: Amanda Seyfried Holds Hands With New Boyfriend Desmond Harrington</span></a>
