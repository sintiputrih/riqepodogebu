She achieved acclaim years later with the 1972 drama, Sounder, where she famously played Rebecca Morgan—a role that earned her an Oscar nomination.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also broke ground in theater and on television, playing the starring role in the 1974 TV film, The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, and Binta in the 1977 miniseries Roots. More recently, she has played Ophelia Harkness, mother to Viola Davis's Annalise Keating in How to Get Away with Murder.</p><img alt="cicely tyson with emmy awards" title="Cicely Tyson With Emmy Awards" width=2444 height=3584 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actress-cicely-tyson-holds-the-two-emmy-awards-that-she-won-news-photo-1611882101.?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Michael Ochs Archives</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Tyson with her two Emmy Awards for The Autobiography Of Miss Jane Pittman in 1974.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pioneering actress is known for eschewing roles that promoted racist, demeaning, or over-sexualized stereotypes, challenging how Hollywood would portray Black women onscreen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I have to tell you, there was so much going on at that time that was projecting negative images of Black women that my mission was to change that," she told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/emmys-cicely-tyson-reflects-her-723208 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2014. "I said, 'Yes, we have drug addicts, and prostitutes and low-lifes, but we also have doctors, lawyers and teachers, and we have women who are just mothers to their children and wives to their husbands that have decency about who they are and what they are and why they are on the face of this earth.'
