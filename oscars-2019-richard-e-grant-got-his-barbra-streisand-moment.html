Grant</strong> is a longtime <a href=#><strong>Barbra Streisand</strong></a> fan, and the Can You Ever Forgive Me? star finally got his moment with the icon, 76, at the <a href=#>91st</a> <a href=#>Academy Awards</a> on Sunday, February 24.</p><p>The actor, 61, was spotted taking a selfie with Streisand at the Oscars ceremony after he and his costar <a href=#><strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong> </a>talked to the 10-time <a href=#>Grammy</a> winner. Grant, who wore a red suit to the ceremony, was all smiles during their interaction.</p><p>The Downton Abbey alum showed his love for Streisand during the awards show too. When the singer took to the stage to introduce one of the night’s nominees, <a href=#>BlacKkKlansman</a>, Grant grabbed his chest and yelled, “Wow!”</p><p>“Being Oscar nominated was pretty amazing, but meeting with @barbrastreisand and having a proper conversation was an absolute astonishment,” he wrote on Instagram on Monday, February 25. “40 carat Gold.”</p><p>He isn’t a new fan of the Brooklyn native. In fact, Grant wrote Streisand a letter when he was only 14 — and took a selfie in front of her house last month.</p><p>“Anyone who’s a lifelong fan of someone will understand what it felt like for me to take this snap outside @barbrastreisand‘s house in Malibu, having written to her when I was 14 years old,” he captioned his selfie on Instagram at the time. “I asked Security for permission, and he said, ‘It’s a public road, but thanks for asking’. My wife @joandialect has generously accommodated my lifelong fandom.”</p><p>He also included <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a screenshot of his letter</a>, which invited the actress to his family home if she was feeling “tired and pressurized” by her fame.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Streisand<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> tweeted a response</a> to Grant’s letter last month. “Dear Richard, what a wonderful letter you wrote me when u were 14,” she said. “And look at u now! You’re terrific in your latest movie with Melissa. Congratulations and love Barbra.”</p><p>In addition to finally meeting Striesand at the Academy Awards, the nominee also posed for pics with <a href=#><strong>Chadwick Boseman</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Emilia Clarke</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Octavia Spencer</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKasm5GnwG5%2Bj2pwZqqZmLWivsNmnGafopa7tXnGqKtmoJmoeqOt0ZupmmWjqb%2BmtdKapZ1lnaS6prrTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lady-gaga-shares-rarely-seen-makeup-free-selfie.html><span>←</span><span>Lady Gaga shares rarely seen makeup-free selfie and wow</span></a>
