These people haven't offered any firm theories as to why Meadows' face might be so messed up, but it's possible that he has a cut above his eye, as well as a bruise on his right cheek and a cut on his lip. All of that is just speculation at this point, and it's possible that the apparent damage to his face is just a trick of the light.</p><p>If it isn't, though, and someone actually hit Meadows, the exact culprit behind the injuries is a mystery.</p><p>"Someone talk about Mark Meadows and his face. He got beat up or biatch slapped. The scratches down his nose and inner eye, plus lip!" one person wrote on Twitter, encouraging cable news pundits to discuss the former chief of staff's apparent injuries.</p><p>Meadows has been charged for his role in aiding and abetting Trump's attempt to overturn the results of the election in Georgia, which included a fake electors scheme and a call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Rafensperger in which Trump tried to pressure Rafensperger to find him extra votes. Whether he got hit or not, it's possible that the injuries he sustained are the least of his problems at the moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSmmaKgeq6xwJ2msKtdm66ksQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-portrait-king-charles-queen-consort-camilla-prince-william-princess-kate.html><span>←</span><span>See King Charles, Queen Consort Camilla, Prince William, and Princess Kate in New Portrait</span></a>
