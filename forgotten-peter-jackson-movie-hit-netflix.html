Yes, 2009’s literary adaptation The Lovely Bones was initially positioned as a major awards season contender, which was no surprise when it boasted the Oscar-laden trio of Jackson, Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens as the creative driving forces, not to mention a star-studded ensemble that featured Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, Stanley Tucci, Susan Sarandon and Saoirse Ronan.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/the-lovely-bones.jpg alt="the lovely bones" width=1777 height=999 sizes="(max-width: 1777px) 100vw, 1777px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, though, it was greeted tepidly by critics and still holds a meager Rotten Tomatoes score of 32%, with the wild tonal shifts coming in for particular fire, although the performances and visuals were largely praised. Tucci did pick up a deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor as well, but the movie itself flopped at the box office after earning just $93 million on a $65 million budget.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>It marked a change of pace for <strong>Peter Jackson</strong> following a decade of blockbuster fantasy, and The Lovely Bones is now streaming on Netflix for those intrigued to see the director try his hand at something different.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8WoqaCnpKmyr3nPnqueql2frqS30qilZqWfq7ameceiq2amlamzrbXXaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./baby-ariel.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Baby Ariel?
