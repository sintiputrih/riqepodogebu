The film stars Zoey Deutch and <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dylan O’Brien</a></strong>, both of whom are gorgeous and have a pretty big fan base. However, O’Brien definitely wins in this case, considering the character he plays is so different from his real life persona. His fans took note, and while we love Dylan O’Brien, something about him playing F-Boy Colin really did it for some fans.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=543 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true>Dylan O’Brien rose to fame in projects such as Teen Wolf and The Maze Runner series and since then he’s remained one of the more successful Teen Wolf alums. This new project, Not Okay, showcases him as an F-Boy influencer named Colin who will do anything for his fifteen seconds of fame. The movie is about our current climate with influencers and how they actually do influence us whether we want them to or not, but, honestly, most viewers are just taking the movie as an opportunity to thirst over Dylan with his bleached hair.</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=124 data-injectable=false>Twitter user @dyldobr1en has been quite vocal with their thirst for Dylan with multiple tweets about his role in the movie.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>and this moment right here i had already buried any feminism left in my body <a href=#>#NotOkayMovie</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yjJvAiNHMp</a></p>— lana dylan o'brien's piss filled catheter bag (@DYLDOBR1EN) <a href=#>July 29, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>THEY'RE JUST LIKE ME <a href=#>#NotOkayMovie</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MHJHSIbv2J</a></p>— lana dylan o'brien's piss filled catheter bag (@DYLDOBR1EN) <a href=#>July 29, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>SHE'S DOWN BAD JUST LIKE ME <a href=#>#NotOkayMovie</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/iUfqlz9vci</a></p>— lana dylan o'brien's piss filled catheter bag (@DYLDOBR1EN) <a href=#>July 21, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>They took to even comparing themselves to the show’s main character, who is objectively not a good person, all because she wanted to hookup with Dylan O’Brien.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>With lines like “my damaged little girl” it was only a matter of time before Twitter got ahold of it and went meme-crazy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>when dylan o’brien said “my damaged little girl.” <a href=#>#NotOkayMovie</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XkdxXqV6KM</a></p>— öykü 𐐪𐑂 (@DYLS1989) <a href=#>July 29, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>never in my life did i expect to hear dylan o'brien moaning "oh you're so tight" or "who's my damaged little girl" but here i am, living this dream. <a href=#>#NotOkayMovie</a></p>— angie 💫not okay era💫 (@dob_slut) <a href=#>July 29, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>yeahh it would be exactly like that.<a href=#>#NotOkayMovie</a> <a href=#>#DylanOBrien</a> <a href=#>#ZoeyDeutch</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zLhjNnbsRk</a></p>— dylan o'brien supporter (@obsessionxdylan) <a href=#>July 21, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>From his sexual lines, to sex scenes to just his fanbase in general, casting Dylan O’Brien in any role means you’ll get an audience, but this one was different.

Influencer and celebrity culture is something many aspire to, and some are willing to do whatever it takes to get to that level of fame, even if it hurts others. So, I guess what we’re saying is, start the movie for Dylan’s looks, but finish the movie with a newfound takeaway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9KtqZ6ZnZq%2FtHnAq5xmmV2kuG7DyK2fZpypoa6vec6bqaKdnqh6qbvTp5ysq12ZsrS8yK2cZqGkYruwwIybnKKml2LBqbGMqaaipqRivKd5zairZqeblsZw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jacob-duran-net-worth-cars-and-houses-how-rich-is-jacob-duran.html><span>←</span><span>Jacob Duran Net Worth, Cars and Houses: How rich is Jacob Duran?</span></a>
