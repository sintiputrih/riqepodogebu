We are ready!!!!” the actress wrote. She looked so overjoyed to be with her son, whom she affectionally calls “Santi.” The 3-year-old was dressed in a blue and green T-shirt and matching shorts.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The mother-son duo appear to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>be on vacation</a> somewhere tropical, based on the background, as well as their choice of attire. Eva sat in a fancy brown chair at a long table. Santi sweetly stood on his famous mother’s legs, as Eva held her son up while cheesing for the camera. Her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sun-kissed skin</a> was glowing in the image, as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Eva-longoria-Rocks-White-One-Piece-Swimsuit-splash-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Eva, who is married to businessman <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jose Antonio Baston</strong></a>, has such a flawless figure thanks to her regimented workouts. The Texas native discussed <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her exercise routines</a> — which includes lifting weights and&nbsp;Rebounding, a type of trampoline workout — with&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Women’s Health</a>&nbsp;for the magazine’s March 2022 cover story. “It makes me present,” she said of the exercise. “You really have to focus on the routine&nbsp;and memorize the movements. They switch sides a lot, which can throw you off, so you have to be on top of it. I love that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In addition to working out, Eva is also passionate about <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>healthy eating</a>. “I&nbsp;grew up on a ranch where we ate what was on the land—when it was squash season, we ate squash for three months. It gave me such an appreciation for where food comes from: It comes from the ground. Beans are a big source of protein for us. I love making portobello tacos and jackfruit tacos, and cauliflower fried rice,” she told&nbsp;Women’s Health.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5BrZp6ukWK5sLrGqKmimV2starAxGaqsKGdqMKqwIysrKallad6sbTOraZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./claude-scott-mitchell-10-facts-to-know.html><span>←</span><span>Claude Scott-Mitchell: 10 Facts To Know</span></a>
