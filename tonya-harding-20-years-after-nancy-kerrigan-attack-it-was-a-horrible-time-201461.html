It's been exactly 20 years since<strong> Nancy Kerrigan </strong>was attacked in an assault orchestrated by the ex-husband of her U.S. Olympic teammate <strong>Tonya Harding</strong> on Jan. 6, 1994, but the pain still seems fresh for Kerrigan.</p><p>"I really don't look back unless someone asks me to look back, and then I have to," Kerrigan, now 44, recently told <a href=#>USA TODAY Sports</a>. "Otherwise, why would I? I was attacked." The retired figure skater said she hasn't spoken or seen Harding since the incident. "Never. No," she said. "For what?"</p><p>Two days before the United States Figure Skating Championships were held ahead of the 1994 Winter Olympics, Kerrigan, then 25, was clubbed on her right knee by an assailant, removing her from the competition. Harding's ex-husband and three other men later pleaded guilty to the attack, and Harding, then 23, pleaded guilty to hindering the prosecution.</p><p>Kerrigan now lives in Boston with her three children and husband, agent Jerry Solomon. Harding, now 43, lives in Oregon with third husband Joseph Jens Price and their son.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"It was 20 years ago and I don't remember lots and lots of it," she told USA TODAY Sports. "I know it was a horrible time for everyone involved. It was a bad streak, going through all the crud, and I was able to rise above it.
