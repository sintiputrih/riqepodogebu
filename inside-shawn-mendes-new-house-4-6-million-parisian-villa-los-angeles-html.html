The 4,000-square-foot home sits on a 6,271-square-foot lot and has five bedrooms and six bathrooms. It boasts a two-car garage, a zero-edge swimming pool, a “cathedral-style” guest house, a grassy&nbsp; lawn, and a “privacy lounge.”</p><p id=par-4_37>The remodeled two-story villa now has a contemporary Parisian villa vibe, featuring French-influenced architectural flourishes and a clean, minimal European aesthetic. There are earthy colors and textures throughout, including intricate stonework, cream-colored plaster, and expansive marble slabs.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_42>The visual centerpiece of the home is an eye-catching kitchen island with curved edges lined in hand-applied pleated French clay. The kitchen has peaceful views through sliding glass doors of an Italian-inspired outdoor area full of dozens of mature Italian cypress trees.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2 id=h-shawn-mendes-also-has-a-1-75-million-penthouse-in-toronto-canada>Shawn Mendes also has a $1.75 million penthouse in Toronto, Canada</h2><p id=par-6_38>The singer may have just picked up a new house in Los Angeles, but this isn’t Shawn Mendes’ first home.

The building was built in 2011, and Mendes’ 1,444 square-foot penthouse has three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The living room features floor-to-ceiling windows with a great view of the Rogers Center.</p><p id=par-8_42>Besides the purchase fee of $1.75 million, Mendes must also pay additional monthly fees estimated at $1,114 for other amenities and services like security and maintenance.
