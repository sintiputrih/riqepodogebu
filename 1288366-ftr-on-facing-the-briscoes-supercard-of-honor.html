And I haven’t won very many fights. I’ve been in a lot of fights with my best friends, too. And when things like that happen, you get done with your fights, and you respect the guy a little bit more. And I think that’s what it was tonight. We’ve honestly, [Cash] is my best friend. We’ve never met those guys before Final Battle. And tonight was our first time ever touching in a professional wrestling match. And god, when you have something like that, and it happens tonight, it doesn’t happen every single day. And we were lucky enough that somebody decided to allow that to happen and we were lucky enough to have it with those guys and we understood that. And when guys are that tough, and they wanna be as good, and they wanna match your intensity, match your athleticism, your enthusiasm, your physicality, you can’t help but respect them.”</p><p>&nbsp;“I think the thing about it for us, like he said, like the harder you hit somebody, I think the more respect you earn from them when they hit you back, and they don’t fold. And all this with those guys, and I hate to use this word because it’s overused, but it was organic. Like we never started messaging each other saying hey let’s set something up. It was just, there was buzz that started online and people started, hey we wanna see this match. And for a while we didn’t even respond. And we finally said let’s throw some fuel on the fire, they keep talking their trash so let’s show them how it’s done. And the whole thing’s been a roller coaster.</p><p>“We didn’t know when the match was gonna happen, if, where, when. But this guy never met it die and we found it was gonna happen probably about a day before all you guys did. It was literally about a day before. I made plans this weekend to be home in North Carolina, like I was supposed to be home with my family right now. And we got the news and I said who needs family? So that’s the thing. That’s the thing, with these guys, it’s always been about being real. They were real, they were real, we weren’t trying to be anything we weren’t, and neither were they. And I think people appreciate that. And then the match out there tonight, we weren’t trying to go out there and have this super fancy contest. We just wanted to fight and to feel it.”</p><p>&nbsp;“And I think ultimately in real life, they think they’re as great as guys they are, and as much respect as we have for them, they really think that they’re the best tag team of all time. And obviously, myself and Cash think that there’s no other tag team that can do the stuff that we can do, and that makes for a great competition.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>WWE NXT(2x) Tag Team Champions<br>WWE RAW (2x) Tag Team Champions<br>WWE Smackdown Tag Team Champs<br>AEW World Tag Team Champions<br>AAA World Tag Team Champions<br>ROH World Tag Team Champions</p><p>6-star FTR <a href=#>https://t.co/cyXnMSWpbe</a></p><p>— Uncle Dax FTR (@DaxFTR) <a href=#>April 2, 2022</a></p><p>We had no plans on shaking their hands after the match. It wasn’t something like we thought it would be a cool moment. But sometimes the best moments are when you’re in the moment and it just happens. And after that, as much as I would love to punch them in the mouth every single night because I wanna show the world we are the best and I think this right here [points to the titles] does that, there’s nothing they should be ashamed of. They shouldn’t hold their heads down. They should hold their heads up, and we wanted to make sure that they knew that and that we appreciate what they’ve done, not just for wrestling but especially for Ring of Honor.</p><p>FTR then spoke about the hype behind the match and how it got plenty of buzz the last couple months, as well as how they hoped to deliver something great to the fans that met expectations.</p><p>&nbsp;“For me, I’ve been so nervous. I’ve been so nervous because as much as I talk tough, I wanna deliver to the fans because without them, I can’t go home to my beautiful wife and my beautiful daughter and feed them. And so delivering a match that would live up to their expectations scared the sh-t out of me.”</p><p>&nbsp;“Especially while trying to stay true to ourselves, like wrestling the style that we’re gonna wrestle when fans are kinda more used to car crashes.”</p><p>&nbsp;“I had an idea of what I wanted it to be, and we had an idea of what we wanted it to be, but man you never know if you can hit the marks that the fans want to see. And as soon as we got out there and hearing them and seeing how excited they were just for the match, that meant the world to me, man. That’s the stuff that I live for.”</p><p>Check out full results from Supercard Of Honor, including the FTR vs. Briscoes match, Samoa Joe’s debut, Minoru Suzuki’s title win and more at .</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFxb2xuZmKztb6MqKVmnpGYtq%2BzjK2fnmWSp7a0r86eqmarpaWys6%2FAq5tmp5ZitbC6zqs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./feather-river-california.html><span>←</span><span>Feather River California Temple | Church News Almanac</span></a>
