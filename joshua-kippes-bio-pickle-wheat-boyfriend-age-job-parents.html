Love you, guys!”</span></p><p><span>In April 2023, the lovebirds then welcome their daughter Maemi Rae. “Southern moms be like “ I ain’t putting all that crap on my baby like everyone else does”…. Yet here we are! 😂😂🥰BABY MAEMI IS HERE,” Joshua shared the good news on IG.</span></p><p><span>Also, in a different post, she once labeled her daughter as a “raindrop on a rose pedal born from a stalk of thorns.”</span></p><p><span>Prior to Joshua, Pickle dated her </span><i><span>Swamp People</span></i><span> co-star Troy Landry. And before him, she was in a relationship with another co-star Chase Landry.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span> Joshua’s daughter’s name “Maemi” in Japanese means “smile of truth.”</span></p><h3><b>Was Joshua Kippes Previously Married?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, Joshua Kippes was previously married to Rachel Elizabeth Kippes. Infact, the two only celebrated their anniversary in April 2019. They broke up sometime after that.</span></p><p><span>Before the divorce, Joshua felt like the luckiest man on earth as he believed his ex-wife was his soulmate. “Marry a girl who goes to all of your favorite restaurants, just to have all of your favorite appetizers waiting for you at home when you get off of work.

We are so lucky to have you in our lives and I couldn’t imagine life without you,” he once wrote on FB.</span></p><p><span>As for their kids, Joshua and Rachel share three children named Emerson, Addie, and Ben.

But it was Eddie’s father “Pop” was the one who established the concept for the game call years ago. Early in the 1970s, Pop would find slate from a long-since-demolished fort in Shell Beach, Louisiana, cut it into squares, plane it to a specific thickness, add a hand-carved striker, and presto — he was talking turkey.</span></p><h3><b>Joshua Kippes Job</b></h3><p><span>Joshua Kippes is an Emergency Medical Technician at New Orleans EMS.</span></p><p><span>In case of emergencies, his job was to perform CPR and ventilations while the paramedic crew would prepare the more advanced treatment like medications, intubation, etc.</span></p><p><span>Keep in mind, he’s an EMT, not a paramedic. A paramedic would make preparations based on what the patient needs and provide them as soon as the EMT is done with the initial steps to stabilize them.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Joshua’s baby mama Pickle is an alligator hunter featured on </span><i><span>Swamp People</span></i><span>.
