During this period, he won the 2003 US Open, finished 2003 as the year-end No 1 and reached the 2004 Wimbledon final.</p><p>Tennis legend Andre Agassi also won six of his eight Grand Slam titles under Gilbert’s guidance and once labelled him the “greatest coach of all-time.”</p><p>Gauff added the 20-time ATP titlist to her team earlier this month at the WTA 500 event in Washington – a tournament she won without dropping a set.</p><p>The world No 7 then reached the quarter-finals in Montreal last week, losing to eventual champion Jessica Pegula.

He’s very good at layering in information and kinda simplifying [the] game plan, he’s a master strategist.</p><p>“There will be no shot that any one of the opponents is gonna hit. Now there’s what they hit sometimes and what they hit under pressure, and he’s very good at finding the differentiators between those two because they’re not always the same.</p><p>“Her (Gauff) being able to get in and come to the net, I feel like she’s making those decisions before she’s actually hitting the approach shot, right? There’s a sense of commitment to it all.</p><p>“Sticking the forehand cross-court, taking big swings on the backhand, mixing up pace up the line. I just couldn’t [not] love what I’m seeing from Coco Gauff right now.”</p><p>Gauff will face world No 1 Iga Swiatek in the last four of the WTA 1000 event on Saturday.
