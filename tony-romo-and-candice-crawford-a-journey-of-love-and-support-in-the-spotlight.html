The two reportedly began dating in 2009 and married only two years later, in June 2011. Their love evolved through the years, and Tony would praise Candice for being so mindful of his football obligations because she stepped up as a great mother and wife.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Difficulties and Hurdles as a High-Profile Public Couple</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tony and Candice were a high-profile couple facing the trials of keeping their relationship intact under public scrutiny. Candice's work as a sports journalist, paired with Tony's NFL stardom, kept the couple in front of media cameras and tabloids. Of course, the pressures of Tony's athletic career and Candice's own media presence likely brought their fair share of demands to bear on a potential marriage.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true></span></h2><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Growing Family<br></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Romo family grew with three boys coming to town, as Hawkins, Rivers, and Jones arrived were born. For them, the </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>greatest</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> milestones that occurred in their marriage&nbsp;was when they brought children into this world. Every major step in their family life has formed the solid, loving bond they maintain today.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Building and Strengthening the Love</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tony and his wife Candice have presented the picture of a happy couple in their public personae despite having two demanding careers. The way they can lean on one another, especially during Tony's pivotal transition from NFL quarterback to commentator, proves even more that those trying times were nothing compared to their commitment and loyalty.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The tale of Tony Romo and Candice Crawford is as old as time. Love in the face of public scrutiny coupled with two people each breaking their neck to build an empire for themselves stands out among many.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miln6RfqbyvxYyrpqanXZa7pXnCmqWdoZOaeqS%2BwLCdqKqUYq5uts6uqaedqWK8p3nLqK2eZZGjsW6%2F1KmnqKqkYravedOhnGaroKTBrbXGoas%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-kimmel.html><span>←</span><span>Jimmy Kimmel's Eldest Daughter Katie Kimmel Is Engaged.
