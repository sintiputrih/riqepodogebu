I was in the south, it was, like, my only opportunity to carry myself and understand what that meant as a girl, as a woman, to be intelligent, to be able to speak, connect with people. For me, it was perfect.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ali-Landry-No-Daughter-in-Pageant-World-02.jpg><p>On top of that, Landry doesn’t want Estela to become “a little spoiled brat,” she told Us. The Eve alum also would like to keep her daughter as “innocent and sweet and young for as long as [she] can.”</p><p>Between her children, her career and <a href=#>her marriage</a>, the actress&nbsp;told Us how she balances being a working mom and wife. “I try to look at it in a month span, or a three-month span, and I kind of have a pie in my head,” she explained. “Which part’s family? Which part is my business? Which part is my husband, which part is my personal growth? So that has helped me because I am a little OCD. It’ll stay on my mind.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She went on to say that she “would love to meet the person” who does this perfectly, but as for herself, she knows that “something is going to always fail or fall short.”</p><p>“I’m cool with that and I truly believe that sometimes it’s more important for your life to be out of balance,” she told Us.</p><p>With reporting by Emily Marcus</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaapJliuaK6w6uwZpyfmsCvwIywmKesXZmutrPHrZyrZWFmeqq6jKmYoJ2Ro8Fuw86ro51n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rokishi.html><span>←</span><span>rokishi - Wrestlezone</span></a>
