In addition to "<a href=#>Criminal Minds</a>," Mantegna is known for his work on "The Godfather Part III," "Joan of Arcadia," and his breakthrough role in "Glengarry Glen Ross." He's also an award-winning stage actor who has appeared in several on- and off-Broadway productions, per his <a href=#>IMDb</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But perhaps his forgotten role was in "Frasier," where he played Derek Mann. Mann's whole&nbsp;schtick&nbsp;is that he's a vocal critic of Dr. Frasier Crane, to the point that it nearly came to fisticuffs. He wrote a column in the newspaper called "I Hate Frasier Crane" — how much more obvious can his hatred get? But you know how "Frasier" goes — it's all about callers, which means Derek wasn't&nbsp;actually on screen, so we never got to see Mantegna.</p><p>But Frasier, played by Kelsey Grammer, diffused the situation perfectly. When Mann called into the show to set up a fight with the good doctor, <a href=#>his response was,</a> "I just don't think that civilized people behave that way. You know, Roz, perhaps our listeners have an opinion about that subject?" Well done!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1nboJze9OhnGabop66qrrApWSmoZ6ZwG6%2F05qpZrGfqnqnu9Ggpq1lkaW9pq3RnptmoZ5is7Ot0qKcq2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./star-trek-picard-reveals-nines-tragic-backstory.html><span>←</span><span>Star Trek: Picard Reveals Seven Of Nines Tragic Backstory</span></a>
