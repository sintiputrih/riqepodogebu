It involves scammers getting in touch about items listed on Facebook Marketplace.</p><p>Speaking on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Reddit</a>, one person shared a screenshot of one such interaction and asked "Is this some kind of scam?" They were selling a Dutch bike with a basket, and received a message asking if it was available.</p><p>After confirming, they received the following message: "I take, I would like to come tomorrow but I am currently busy with work, I will send a FEDEX postman to your home to give you your cash and collect the item."</p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Man 'scammed' in Kings Cross station by man 'pretending to have been mugged'</a></p><p>The person selling the bike further clarified: "Is a new scam that anyone’s heard of? I put my bike up for sale on Facebook Marketplace and have had three messages like this on the same post all saying they’ll sent a courier and then asking for my details. Just thought it was so bizarre."</p><p>People rushed to the comments to advise them and share their own experiences. One person said it was "100 per cent a scam, and a very common one at that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article26628506.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Screenshot-2023-04-04-120741.png><p>Another wrote: "Yeah it's a scam, a courier (especially well known ones such as FedEx) wouldn't turn up with cash in hand to collect. Just don't trust anyone which says that they will send a courier."</p><p>"I had similar," another person commented. "I just ignored the person but when I came back to the message they had all been removed automatically by FB and the profile deleted.</p><p>"I didn't even make a report to FB. They tend to target big heavy items which are a pain to transport (mine was a set of car tyres)."</p><p>Another Londoner added: "Always just say collect in person, and opt for transfer over cash, some people try to use fake money. A shame business can never be done straight up but that’s the world, bad people exist."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article26627865.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1350000790.jpg><p>FedEx and other delivery companies mentioned in the scam don't offer any services where they deliver money and pick up an item. The scam could cost you hundreds should you agree to selling your items this way.</p><p>After you agree, the scammer will ask for your full name, address and e-mail. They'll let you know you need to pay an insurance fee for the money supposedly being delivered, but that they'll reimburse you.</p><p>You'll then receive a legitimate-looking email seemingly from a delivery company with a payment link inside. Once you click it, you'll be taken to a fraudulent site that will charge you hundreds for the 'insurance', which you won't get back.</p><p>If you come across a Facebook Marketplace scam, it's best not to interact with them. You can also report and block them by clicking on their profile.</p><p><b>Sign up to MyLondon's Going Out Out for the very best of what's going on in the city <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>.</b></p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rsXLqKWdp55ju6bD0miuoZmkqHqwuo6sn6iooJ67qHvFmpqemp%2BkuG65wKuinqygoa6ksYysmpqlXZi8tMCMoaynnKKasbR5kW9ta25lbn4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./india-love-biography-net-worth-boyfriend-age-height-ethnicity-songs-movies.html><span>←</span><span>India Love Biography: Net Worth, Boyfriend, Age, Height, Ethnicity, Songs, Movies, Siblings, Parents</span></a>
