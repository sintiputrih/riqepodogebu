The speed of the transfer is limited by the lowest common denominator on the network, so if you have gigabit Ethernet capable computers but a 100 Mbit capable router, you are limited to 100 Mbit transfer.&nbsp; Note that this is really a formality – if a network port is rated at 1 Gbps, then chances are that it will hit at least 90+% of this value.&nbsp; The main test here is CPU usage, and how much is offloaded by the controller.&nbsp; For this test, we use LAN Speed Test to transfer a 1000 MB file across a home network with a 100 Mbps lowest common speed to the same machine each time, in a read/write scenario.&nbsp; CPU usage is taken as a visual max/average from task manager.</p><p><img alt="LAN Speeds" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph4522/39773.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="LAN CPU Usage" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph4522/39774.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The P67H2-A falls relatively in the middle compared to other boards we've tested in terms of network performance, and below the P67 average overall in peak CPU usage.</p><p><strong>USB Speed</strong></p><p>For this benchmark, we run CrystalDiskMark to determine the ideal sequential read and write speeds for the USB port using our 64GB Patriot SuperSpeed USB 3.0 drive.&nbsp; Then we transfer a set size of files from the SSD to the USB drive, and monitor the time taken to transfer.&nbsp; The files transferred are a 1.52 GB set of 2867 files across 320 folders – 95% of these files are small typical website files, and the rest (90% of the size) are the videos used in the Sorenson Squeeze test.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="USB 2.0 Sequential Speeds" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph4522/39776.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>USB 2.0 write speed is fairly lacking on the ECS board in terms of sequentials, losing 3 MBps to the P67 average.</p><p><img alt="USB 3.0 Sequential Speeds" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph4522/39777.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Also here, the USB 3.0 sequential write speeds are below the P67 average.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="USB Copy Performance" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph4522/39778.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In terms of real world copy performance however, it looks like the ECS driver does the job compared to almost every other board tested.</p><p><strong>SATA Testing</strong></p><p>We also use CrystalDiskMark for SATA port testing.&nbsp; The operating system is installed on the Micron RealSSD C300, which is rated at 355 MB/s read and 215 MB/s write, and the sequential test is run at the 5 x 1000 MB level.&nbsp; This test probes the efficiency of the data delivery system between the chipset and the drive, or in the case of additional SATA ports provided by a third party controller, the efficiency between the controller, the chipset and the drive.</p><p><img alt="SATA 6 Gbps Sequential Speeds" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph4522/39780.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>At peak speeds with the C300, the ECS board is one of the best we've tested on the SATA 6 Gbps PCH ports. &nbsp;</p><p><img alt="SATA 3 Gbps Sequential Speeds" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph4522/39779.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This is also echoed in the SATA 3 Gbps results.</p><p><strong>DPC Latency</strong></p><p>Deferred Procedure Call latency is a way in which Windows handles interrupt servicing.&nbsp; In order to wait for a processor to acknowledge the request, the system will queue all interrupt requests by priority.&nbsp; Critical interrupts will be handled as soon as possible, whereas lesser priority requests, such as audio, will be further down the line.&nbsp; So if the audio device requires data, it will have to wait until the request is processed before the buffer is filled.&nbsp; If the device drivers of higher priority components in a system are poorly implemented, this can cause delays in request scheduling and process time, resulting in an empty audio buffer – this leads to characteristic audible pauses, pops and clicks.&nbsp; Having a bigger buffer and correctly implemented system drivers obviously helps in this regard.&nbsp; The DPC latency checker measures how much time is processing DPCs from driver invocation – the lower the value will result in better audio transfer at smaller buffer sizes.&nbsp; Results are measured in microseconds and taken as the peak latency while cycling through a series of short HD videos - under 500 microseconds usually gets the green light, but the lower the better.</p><p><img alt="DPC Latency Maximum" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph4522/39775.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The ECS board is one of the best we've had in terms of DPC latency.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIF2fpFonJyrXaWDeLSRmmSrnaaesrh5wGatoquZqXqjrcKkZK2nXaHCpLXDrGShsZSnrnCB</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lenny-montana-net-worth-163538.html><span>←</span><span>Lenny Montana Net Worth</span></a>
