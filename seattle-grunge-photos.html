In the early 1980s, grunge's first incarnations -- primarily a mix of punk rock and heavy metal -- began with bands like The Fartz, The U-Men, and the Fastbacks.<p>Pictured: The U-Men perform at the Bat Cave in Seattle in the mid-1980s.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span> <img alt="The Melvins" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/the-melvins.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Formed just outside of Seattle, the Melvins were one of the earliest and most influential bands of the era. Said Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, "There’s just no way I couldn’t have let the Melvins influence me, they’re just such a great band."<p>Pictured: The Melvins pose in London in 1991.</p></span><span class=credit>David Corio/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Nirvana In 1989" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nirvana-1989.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>At the forefront of grunge's mainstream success was Nirvana.

Riding off the immense popularity of "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nevermind would go on to sell more than 30 million copies worldwide and pave the way for major record labels to sign alternative bands.<p>Pictured: Nirvana plays at Beehive Records in Seattle on September 16, 1991 for the release of Nevermind.</p></span><span class=credit>Charles Peterson</span> <img alt="Nirvana Flannel" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nirvana-flannel.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Cheap clothing in Seattle was found in secondhand shops, and because of the region's prominence in the logging industry, used lumberjack attire was the most readily available. This meant that bands often sported flannel shirts, which became the distinctive fashion statement of the grunge era.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span> <img alt="Kurt Cobain" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/kurt-cobain.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Rolling Stone called Kurt Cobain the "spokesman of a generation."

But the album picked up momentum after the release of singles "Alive" and "Jeremy," and eventually sold more than 10 million copies.</span><span class=credit>Alison Braun/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Eddie Vedder" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/eddie-vedder.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Pearl Jam became famed for the intensity of their live performances.

Their debut album, Facelift, was released in August 1990 to much critical acclaim. Though the album did not sell as many copies as subsequent grunge smashes, it claimed new ground for alternative rock in mainstream music.<p>Pictured: Alice In Chains pose for their first group photograph after they signed to Columbia Records in 1989.</p></span><span class=credit>Annamaria DiSanto/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Alice In Chains Offramp Seattle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/alice-in-chains-offramp-seattle.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Alice In Chains perform at the Off Ramp Cafe in Seattle in February 1991.</span><span class=credit>Alison Braun/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Alice In Chains" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/alice-in-chains.jpg> <span class=caption-body>In a tale unfortunately similar to Nirvana's, Alice In Chains' lead singer Layne Staley (second from right) struggled for years with drug addiction and depression. Spending his final years as a recluse and disconnected from his band, Stanley was found dead in his Seattle apartment in 2002 weighing only 86 pounds.</span><span class=credit>Steve Jennings/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Alice In Chains Pearl Jam" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/alice-in-chains-pearl-jam.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Seattle-area grunge bands maintained a camaraderie even in the face of the pressures of success.

Though regarded as one of the seminal bands of the grunge movement, bassist Ben Shepherd dismissed the label, saying, "That's just marketing. It's called rock and roll, or it's called punk rock or whatever. We never were grunge, we were just a band from Seattle."</span><span class=credit>Alison Braun/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Chris Cornell Rip Magazine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chris-cornell-rip-magazine.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Chris Cornell on stage during a RIP Magazine party in Hollywood in October 1991.</span><span class=credit>Jeff Kravitz/Getty Images</span> <img alt="Soundgarden Stage Diving" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/soundgarden-stage-diving.jpg> <span class=caption-body>While Soundgarden enjoyed its greatest commercial success with the release of Superunknown in 1994, it was to be short-lived: The band broke up in early 1997. By this time, Nirvana was no more and Alice In Chains had effectively disbanded -- and the music world moved into a post-grunge era.</span><span class=credit>Jeff Kravitz/Getty Images</span><p>For more, check out this documentary on the Seattle grunge scene:</p><p>Enjoy this look into the Seattle grunge music era?
