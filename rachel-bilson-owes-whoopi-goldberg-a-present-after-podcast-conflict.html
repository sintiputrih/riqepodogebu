But then again, it’s like, ‘Alright, well, if you’re talking about my podcast and I said something, let me respond. Because it’s just going to bring more people to maybe hear the conversation in the first place.'”</p><p>In October, Bilson declared during an episode of her “Broad Ideas” podcast that she’d find it “a little weird” if a man in his 40s only <a href=#>had a few sexual partners</a>. However, she was quick to acknowledge that “it all depends on the person” and it wasn’t “fair” for her to judge anyone’s sexual history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rachel-Bilson-Jokes-She-Owes-Whoopi-Goldberg-a-Present-Over-Publicity-for-Podcast-Conflict2.jpg><p>Goldberg, 67, later said on an episode of The View that she thought <a href=#>it was “very odd”</a> Bilson was “concerned” at all about <a href=#>men’s sex lives</a>.</p><p>“Listen, men, traditionally, were taught to have many sexual partners. That’s how it was. Men could go and do whatever they wanted to do, and women were not supposed to,” Goldberg said at the time. “Now, that has been shifting, and young women have been bitching about, you know, ‘Why are you telling me what I should be [doing?]’ Now, it’s happening [the other way around], and you’re mad. I don’t understand.”</p><p>Goldberg added, “If he’s happy with you and you’re having a good time, why are you bitching?”</p><p>Sunday’s podcast wasn’t the first time <a href=#>Bilson responded</a> to Goldberg’s comments.</p><p>“I want to say that I’ve been a fan of Whoopi’s for a very long time, so when I saw the tagline that she criticized something I said, I of course was concerned,” she told Entertainment Weekly days after the October podcast episode went live. “I think it’s important to hear a whole conversation before casting your own judgment or criticism on something.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rachel-Bilson-Jokes-She-Owes-Whoopi-Goldberg-a-Present-Over-Publicity-for-Podcast-Conflict3.jpg><p>Bilson explained that her show is “a very safe open place to discuss anything,” and she doesn’t like to edit things out.</p><p>“I chose to keep the conversation as a whole in, because a lot of the time in life, you say something, and maybe you have a minute and you reflect on it,” she added. “The point I get across is that it doesn’t matter, and maybe in the past I would’ve looked at it [judgmentally], but I wouldn’t do that anymore. I made it clear that I don’t want to sound judgmental, it was important that that point get across, not what I said initially.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarmZOdsq15waKjrKeeYry4sdJmrqGnn6W2brPOpZubnaKceqJ5z6ucrJ2eqXqistOeqWaon5mwor%2FTZpqoppahtqTAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kunal-rawal-biography-wikipedia-age-family-parents-wife-marriage-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kunal Rawal Biography: Wikipedia, Age, Family, Parents, Wife, Marriage, Net Worth</span></a>
