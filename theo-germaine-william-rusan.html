The couple made their social media debut in December 2017. Theo Germaine’s partner shared a collage and stated their cute things happened late at night for a second. It remains a mystery when the pair started dating, but based on this post, the duo has been together since at least December 2017.</p><p>Theo <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">relocated to</a> LA after their acting career took off. Despite the distance, the pair managed to spend quality time together when Germaine was back in Chicago. In March 2019, they landed the role of James in The Politician, and William took to Instagram to congratulate them. At the same time, Rusan revealed how the couple met.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Theo-and-William-first-met.jpg><p>Theo Germaine’s beau saw them for the first time while they were performing at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago a few years ago. Theo was under a wig, heavy makeup, petticoats, and a corset when Rusan met them. Nevertheless, they found Germaine beautiful and their work enchanting. Rusan then sent a piece of fan mail to Theo, which was the first fan mail the latter ever received.</p><p>The duo wouldn’t fall in love for a few years, but eventually, their relationship blossomed, and the rest is history. The pair are head over heels for one another and are often together on several red-carpet events. From their social media, it is evident that the lovebirds are madly in love. In addition, they have <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">even adopted</a> two cats and post several adorable pictures together.</p><p>Nonetheless, we wish the duo the very best in their lives. Hopefully, their relationship turns out to be happily ever after. We look forward to more updates on their love life.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcMDHnqZmn5WnuqK1zZ5ksKGcobaiuYyrrKyZnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-point-of-match-attax.html><span>←</span><span>What is the point of Match Attax?</span></a>
