The film has some good ideas, but they are utterly hampered by some of the worst scientific logic, biggest plot contrivances, and cavernous logical gaps I have ever seen in a film. This is not a ‘science fiction’ story so much as it is a ‘fictional science’ story, as very little of <strong>Prometheus </strong>could exist in any recognizable layer of reality.</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>With the film now available on home video, allowing us to analyze it to our heart’s content, I figured now would be the perfect time to set in stone every logical issue I could find. Well, some of them. Once my notes had extended past 6,000 words, I decided it was best to cut things off at just 100 issues, and that is the list you see here today. Time codes are included to assist in matching the list with the content of the film.</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>Special thanks to Sean Chapman, my <a href=#>WGTC Radio</a> co-host, who was instrumental in helping to find and clarify many of the points made in this article.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true><strong>UPDATE (10/12)</strong>:&nbsp;As several reader comments have correctly pointed out, my assessment of issue <strong>#11</strong>, seen on the <a href=#>next page</a>, is incorrect. The Prometheus can travel with glass windows because they are covered by metal panels during flight. I have accordingly scratched it off the list, but to keep this article at 100 total issues, I am including a reader-suggested issue as our replacement for #11:</p><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true><strong>Replacement Issue: How could David, an android, play a flute?&nbsp;</strong>As a robot, he would be in no need of lungs or a diaphragm, so where would the air needed to blow into the flute come from? In fact, Holloway and David converse, while prepping for the first expedition, about how David does not breathe, therefore not having the capacity to blow air into a flute. David can presumably speak without lungs or a diaphragm because he has a voice box or chip – which is how he can communicate after his head is severed – but he wouldn’t be able to play a flute.</p><p data-characters=96 data-current-count=96 data-injectable=false>Now, without further ado, let’s dive into <strong>100 Glaring Logical Issues With Prometheus. </strong>Enjoy…</p><p data-characters=35 data-current-count=131 data-injectable=false>Begin reading on the next page…&nbsp;</p>Pages: <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>1</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>3</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>4</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>5</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>6</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>7</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>8</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>9</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonaKbpJ68r63LZqqcoZWjsKZ5kGlnZp%2Bclr%2BqusZmo6ifmZiurXnIrKqunaNixKrAx2anq6edmsGpsdSsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dr-dre-successfully-blocks-marjorie-taylor-greene-from-using-his-music.html><span>←</span><span>Dr. Dre blocks Marjorie Taylor Greene from using his music</span></a>
