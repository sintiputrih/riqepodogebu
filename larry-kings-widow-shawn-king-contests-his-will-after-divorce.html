Shawn is the one with the most knowledge of Larry’s businesses, assets and wishes,” Shawn’s attorneys said in Tuesday’s court filing.</p><p>The lawyers pointed out that Larry Jr., 59, whom the Emmy winner shared with his second wife, Annette Kaye, did not have any relationship with his father until his 30s.</p><p>“[Larry Jr.] has never been involved in Larry’s career or business,” Shawn’s attorneys said, calling it “highly inappropriate to place him in a position of representing Larry’s estate.”</p><p>Prior to going to court, Shawn told the New York Post’s <a href=#>Page Six</a> that she and Larry had drafted “a very watertight family estate plan” in 2015 “as a couple.” She added, “It still exists, and it is the legitimate will.”</p><p>Us previously obtained a will dated October 17, 2019, in which Larry wrote that he wanted “100% of my funds” to go to his kids. He noted that the legal document, which he signed nearly two months after filing for divorce from Shawn, “should replace all previous writings.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Larry died of sepsis at age 87 from after being <a href=#>hospitalized with COVID-19</a>. He is survived by Larry Jr. and his two sons with Shawn: Chance, 21, and Cannon, 20. His children Andy and Chaia, whom he shared with his third wife, Alene Akins, <a href=#>died within three weeks of each other</a> in the summer of 2020. Andy and Chaia were 65 and 51, respectively.</p><p>With reporting by Marjorie Hernandez</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmaKnxm63yKeerGWnnrGww4ysn5qvnmK4qrrGZpqopqSawLW%2FjKGgrGWnnrmtecCfq56qXZm2t7vRnJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./history-news-september-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Interesting History News From September 2023 With History Uncovered</span></a>
