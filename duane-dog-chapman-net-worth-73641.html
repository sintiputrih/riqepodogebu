Throughout the next decade, they had an on-and-off romantic relationship, even marrying others. Beth has two children from previous relationships, Dominic Davis (taken into state custody when Beth was 17 years old) and Cecily Barmore-Chapman (from her previous marriage to her first husband, who was Chapman's best friend in high school). In 1995, Chapman and Beth joined forces in <a href=#>Business</a> and life, finally blending their families and moving in together. Beth runs the bail bonds office and goes bounty hunting with her husband, often counseling the detainees. After 16 years together, they married on May 20, 2006, at a Hilton hotel on Waikoloa Village in <a href=#>Hawaii</a>. Besides Beth's daughter Cecily, whom Chapman has adopted, they have two children together, Bonnie Joanne Chapman and Garry Chapman. Dominic rejoined the family as an adult, when Chapman located him for Beth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeUqq6vsYydpqBlk52usbnAp2SnnaRixLC%2B06FkcGtmaX4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-lord-frederick-windsor-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Lord Frederick Windsor Dating Now</span></a>
