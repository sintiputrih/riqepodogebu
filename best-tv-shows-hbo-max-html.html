It helps to have the (mostly) the entire catalog of the best cable company in history to pull from to populate a streaming service. HBO changed TV, and they’re using the power of that legacy to try and change streaming too. To keep this list in check, we decided to limit it to shows that are all wrapped up: either mini-series or multi-season shows that have aired their finales. So, yeah, you can use Max to catch up on The Last of Us and Succession too, but they won’t be on here until they’re done. (Although ongoing Max originals like Hacks are included.)

This landmark in the medium was created by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, adapted from the WWII history book of the same name by Stephen E.

It’s a mesmerizing drama that hits some peaks that are as high as anything that was on HBO at the time. Steve Buscemi stars as Nucky Thompson in one of the most lavishly detailed period dramas ever to air on television. Buscemi is great, but this one hums because of its supporting cast, including great turns from Michael Shannon, Shea Whigham, Michael Stuhlbarg, Michael Kenneth Williams, and, most of all, Jack Huston.</p>Boardwalk Empire <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clflhpsf601t33b6t9vck1oje@published>Chernobyl</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clflgqpbo00bu3b6t2zuinx2l@published data-word-count=8><strong>Year: </strong>2019<br><strong>Length: </strong>1 season, 5 episodes<br><strong>Creator: </strong>Craig Mazin</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clflhqxz001x13b6tmc8joayf@published data-word-count=94>Before The Last of Us, Craig Mazin helmed one of the most acclaimed miniseries of all time in this five-part drama that horrifically details the failure of a world power to respond to an international crisis.

If you’re wondering why fans were so excited to revisit David Milch’s Western, now is the time for an education. This is one of the smartest, deepest shows in the history of television, a program that takes what we think we know about history and the Old West and uses it to tell human stories that resonate today.

Dern and White completely reinvented the cliché of the character who hits rock bottom with this razor-sharp dramedy, which co-stars Luke Wilson, Diane Ladd, Jason Mantzoukas, Robin Wright, Molly Shannon, and Dermot Mulroney.

The masterstroke here is one of tone with Coel never taking her subject matter anything less than seriously but also not leaning into traditional melodrama or case-of-the-week clichés.
