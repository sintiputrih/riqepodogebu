This game, created in collaboration with Game of Thrones author <a href=#>George R.R.

Here are some tips to help you get through the game's final boss.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FromSoftware</span><p>Radagon of the Golden Order in 'Elden Ring'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to get to the Elden Beast.</h2><p>The final boss of the game appears as a challenger immediately after you defeat Radagon of the Golden Order ‚Äî another Elden Ring boss who is incredibly difficult to tackle. If you've played other FromSoftware games then this likely won't surprise you, but the developers do not give you any breathing room before introducing you to the Elden Beast, meaning you'll have to go into battle with whatever flasks and abilities you have left from your fight with Radagon.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Elden Beast <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EF6Fr3PasW</a></p>‚Äî NF.. üé∂ (@iNF_04) <a href=#>March 13, 2022</a></figure><p>Of course, Radagon's battle can't be started until you've defeated Maliketh; Sir Gideon Ofnir; Godfrey, First Elden Lord; and Hoarah Loux, Warrior (whom Godfrey will transform into during your battle against him).</p><p>Defeating the Elden Beast is the only way to mend the Elden Ring and become an Elden Lord. Completionists will end up facing off against this foe more than once if they want to unlock all of the endings to the game.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What are the Elden Beast's weaknesses?</h2><p>When it comes to facing off against any of the bosses in Elden Ring, your best method is to take some time to learn the boss's patterns of attack to better understand their moveset. Both Radagon and the Elden Beast use a combination of strikes aimed at you and ranged attacks meant to damage anything in their range.</p><p>Since Radagon and the Elden Beast can inflict Holy damage, you'll want to come to the battle prepared with measures that will be resistant to it to keep your health up.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Really, the best method for both of these bosses seems to be to attack from behind whenever possible. Dodging their attacks won't be too difficult, once you've figured out their patterns, and if done correctly, attacking these foes from behind may immobilize them ‚Äî making for an easy way to deal damage.</p><p>You'll also want to make sure you bring in a sturdy <a href=#>Spirit Summons</a> to the battle and save it until the Elden Beast unveils itself. Once your enemy is distracted by the spirit you bring in, attack it from behind.</p><p>Both of these enemies will be difficult to defeat using just melee attacks, so you'll want to use a combination of methods to take them down and finish the game. Good luck!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrmlsc1mmZ6Zo6l6uLHApKWeq6Nisq2wxKdkq6GenA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tmobile-introduce-hspa-equipped-samsung-galaxy-tab-70-plus.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>T-Mobile Introduce HSPA+ Equipped Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus</span></a>
