During a recent episode of the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Hollywood Gold</a>&nbsp;podcast, Finerman explained that people advised him against casting the Oscar-winning actress because she didn't have enough experience in comedy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Anne [Hathaway], we knew is a good every girl. She really is. She went to Vasser. She's a real All-American girl," she said. "And Meryl, people thought we were crazy. I had people call me up and say, 'Are you out of your mind? She's never been funny a day in her life.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, Finerman insisted on moving forward, reminding people of Streep's comedic stint in her film Death Becomes Her. "She has been funny, and they were wrong," she said. "But this was clearly a different kind of world for her. I think that that was part of the fun of the unexpected of seeing her amidst in outfits."&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It turns out, Finerman's instincts were correct; Streep went on to portray the now-iconic character and even earn an Oscar nomination for her work. Streep has also since said that she dove head-first into the character, even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>trying method acting</a> for one of the first times while shooting the 2006 film. “I was so depressed!”&nbsp;she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a> in a 2021 interview. “I said, ‘Well, it's the price you pay for being boss!’ That's the last time I ever attempted a method thing!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a recent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety Actors on Actors interview</a>, Streep's co-stars, Emily Blunt and Anne Hathaway, recalled working with the legend. "I remember Meryl coming up with like 18 different lines on the spot, Stanley [Tucci] doing the same, you, and I was just, like, this kindergartener,"&nbsp;Hathaway joked. Blunt then referenced Streep's short-lived foray into method saying, "Do you know she's never done method acting since? She said it made her so miserable in this one."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6psqRdqMGzscSpZKenpGKztrrNsmSepp%2BqtKl5xaipZpyVq7atedaemKurXaW%2ForDAZm9taWNphXc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kylie-minogue-reveals-why-never-had-children.html><span>←</span><span>Kylie Minogue's brave honesty about why she never had children</span></a>
