You don’t want it to be boiling so I suggest about 30 seconds. Stir in brown sugar, and sugar and mix well until completely combined and smooth. This is an important step as you want the warm butter to dissolve the sugars so take your time with this step.</li><li><strong>Add in one egg yolk and vanilla</strong>. Since this is a small recipe, we are only using an egg yolk instead of an entire egg. It helps to create a chewy texture.</li><li><strong>Stir in flour and baking soda</strong>. If using salted butter, you don’t have to add extra salt but if you are using unsalted butter, add a pinch of salt for flavor.</li><li><strong>Fold in your favorite type of chocolate chips</strong> — milk chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, or dark chocolate or a combination. My favorite types of chocolate chips are Guittard and Ghirardelli. I also love to throw in some chunks of chocolate from the Trader Joe’s Pound Plus Bar.</li><li><strong>Bake just until lightly golden</strong>. Don’t overbake as the cookies will continue to bake after being removed from the oven.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-for-Two-11-scaled.jpg alt="Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe for Two.
