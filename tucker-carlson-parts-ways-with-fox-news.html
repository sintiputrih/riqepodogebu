On top of that, it’s no question that his legions of followers will be more than happy to tune in to wherever he ends up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Friendly reminder that Tucker Carlson already co-founded the very successful Daily Caller news organization</p><p>The sky is the limit with his future <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gZZPEMZr8i</a></p>— DC_Draino (@DC_Draino) <a href=#>April 24, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>Nevertheless, his departure is a net positive for journalism everywhere; the farther we can get the world’s most neurotic liars away from the world stage of information, the better.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING: Tucker Carlson is no longer working at Fox.</p><p>There should be no home to pathological liars who are the definition of fake news.

Who will replace him on Fox News Tonight, and will they manage to find someone even more delusional to fill the void, or is Fox News truly attempting to clean up their act? Whatever the answers may be, there will no doubt be plenty to say, and we’re bracing ourselves for a fair portion of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OumqSdomKwor7LrKanZaCWv7W%2FjLCYsqtdrLa1tIyfprFlnprEtHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stet-howland-net-worth-217627.html><span>←</span><span>Stet Howland Net Worth</span></a>
