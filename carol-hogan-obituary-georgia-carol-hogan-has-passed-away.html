She passed away peacefully, surrounded by her loving family, on March 9, 2023. A devoted wife, Carol and her husband Ken shared 31 beautiful years together, creating cherished memories and a loving bond. As a mother, Carol was deeply cherished by her children: Michael Stamcoff (Susan), Lori Clayton (Steven), and David Stamcoff (Yvonne). She took immense pride in being a Nana to Jennifer, Marshall, Jason (Daniela), Danielle, Breanna, Joey, and a Great-Nana to Harrison, Madylynn, Madison, and Henri. Carol’s loving nature extended to her parents, Olive and the late William Taylor (2007), and she held a special place in her heart for the memory of her late in-laws, Leo and Phoebe Hogan.</p><p>Carol delighted in her pastimes, such as knitting, attending craft shows, and proudly displaying her creations. Her presence exuded positive and upbeat energy, brightening the room and bringing joy to all who knew her. Carol had a fulfilling career as a courtesy driver with the Windsor Police Services, where she shared many laughs and created lasting memories with her good friend Bev. She enjoyed her leisure time by traveling with Ken, indulging in shopping sprees, and trying her luck at the casino.</p><p>Carol’s sister, Judy Marsh, shared a special bond, being not just siblings but also best friends. She also cherished her role as sister-in-law to Dan (Pat) Hogan, Barb (Gary) Hayes, Tom (Marcia) Hogan, and Bob (Lucy) Hogan, and she leaves behind many nieces and nephews, including Chris Neely (Claudene Shaver), who will miss her dearly. The family expresses their heartfelt gratitude to the Villages of St. Clair – Schlegel Villages for their exceptional care and compassion shown to Carol during her time there.</p><p>To honor Carol’s life, family and friends are invited to visit on Monday, March 13, 2023, from 3-5 p.m. and 7-9 p.m. at Families First Funeral Home, located at 1065 Lauzon Rd. A funeral service will be held on Tuesday, March 14, 2023, at 11:30 a.m. at the same location, followed by a procession to Victoria Memorial Gardens. As we bid farewell to Carol, we will remember her with love and gratitude for the joy she brought into our lives and the memories we shared. Her presence will be deeply missed, but the warmth of her spirit will live on in our hearts forever. May she rest in peace, knowing that she leaves behind a legacy of love and laughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwr8CrpqVlmKS0orqMqJmirKWWv7p5xp6mq5%2BZlnqkrdGoo2agn5yur3nHmqpmqJGowKawjJqumrFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./news-who-murat-gonul-ifbb-pro-dies-46.html><span>←</span><span>Who was Murat Gonul?
