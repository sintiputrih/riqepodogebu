My mother's Black and we experienced racism at a very young age," Tamera&nbsp;<a href=# one-link-mark=yes>explained</a> on air. "We went to school in Texas, being called the 'n' word, and I can remember being at the height of our career and loving this particular magazine and asking our publicist to pitch us and they literally came back and said, 'Well, if you are a woman of color, you are Black, you have to be a triple threat to be on our magazine.'" Tamera struggled with this at first, but added, "I used that as fuel, though to keep going," to which other co-hosts — Joy Behar, Sara Haines, Sherri Shepherd (who is also guest-hosting), and Ana Navarro — applauded.</p><p dir=ltr>Despite having experienced racism early on in her career, Tamera was thankful for "Sister, Sister" and the impact it continues to have on audiences, saying, "I feel so grateful now looking back, seeing that this show has become somewhat of a classic. It's now on Netflix and people are still loving it. I'm honored."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2tjaoZ4e9ahmK1ll6e8uLXNoGSuqF2eu27Ax55krKifqbmqs8etZLCZo2K%2Fpq3LpbBmpJmgsm6yzqtkrZmdmr%2BiecyorquxXZ28tr%2FLnrBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./899289-roh-releases-kevin-steen-v-el-generico-last-man-standing-match-video-maria-addresses-hateful-people.html><span>←</span><span>ROH Releases Kevin Steen v Generico Last Man Standing Match (Video), Maria Addresses Hateful People</span></a>
