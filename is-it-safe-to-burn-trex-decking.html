Composite decking does not, and in fact, when the plastic melts, it releases very toxic gases. In the backyard, where you might occasionally drop a charcoal briquet, this doesn’t sound like a big deal.

In the backyard, where you might occasionally drop a charcoal briquet, this doesn’t sound like a big deal.</p><p>Then Is Trex more flammable than wood?</p><p>Fire-Resistance Rating</p><p>Trex decking is classified as a Class C, or Class III, building material. As a result, Trex lumber will burn as wood does, even though it contains several other composite materials.</p><p>Therefore, Will a Trex melt? Polypropylene can start melting at 320° F and PVC at 212° F; Trex itself has stated publicly that their “decking will soften as low as 176 degrees Fahrenheit.”</p><p>Can you put a fire pit on a composite deck? Fire pits, both wood-burning, and gas can be used safely on wood or composite decks provided they are placed a sufficient distance from adjoining structures such as the home, and a heat-resistant barrier is used between the fire pit and the deck to prevent potential structural and cosmetic damage due to the high-heat</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Trex_decking_slippery></span><strong>Is Trex decking slippery?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trex decking is a low-maintenance decking solution that requires a fraction of the work of wood decks and is less likely to get slippery when wet. It still requires occasional attention to keep it looking its best, but you’ll be delighted with the finished results.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Trex_hot_on_your_feet></span><strong>Is Trex hot on your feet?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While wood gets hot enough to make walking with bare feet uncomfortable, composite decking gets even hotter. In some cases, Trex can become so hot that it may become unusable under intense, direct sunlight.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_you_power_wash_Trex_decking></span><strong>Can you power wash Trex decking?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trex does not recommend the use of a pressure washer. The use of a pressure washer on deck surface could damage the decking surface and will void the warranty with respect to any condition caused by the pressure washing.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_are_the_three_grades_of_Trex_decking></span><strong>What are the three grades of Trex decking?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trex deck design comes in three types: Select, Enhance, and Transcend.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_it_safe_to_power_wash_a_Trex_deck></span><strong>Is it safe to power wash a Trex deck?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trex does not recommend the use of a pressure washer. The use of a pressure washer on deck surface could damage the decking surface and will void the warranty with respect to any condition caused by the pressure washing.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_you_put_a_firepit_on_Trex></span><strong>Can you put a firepit on Trex?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wood burning fire pits are not recommended on top of Trex decking unless using a product called DeckProtect™. Wood burning fire pits can damage the decking due to the extreme heat from the bottom of the fire pit and/or burning embers “shooting” onto the decking.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_you_put_salt_on_Trex_deck></span><strong>Can you put salt on Trex deck?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If you own one of the older generation Trex composite decks, such as Accents®, calcium chloride or rock salt may be used but should be rinsed off as soon as possible. Use caution not to scratch your boards when removing snow or ice with a snow shovel and never use a metal snow shovel on an older generation deck.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_you_put_a_fireplace_on_a_Trex_deck></span><strong>Can you put a fireplace on a Trex deck?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You should not place your fire pit directly on your composite decking. Trex decking can soften and become damaged at temperatures as low as 176F. A temperature barrier can be bricks, stone or ceramic tiles or fire mats.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_you_use_a_propane_heater_on_a_composite_deck></span><strong>Can you use a propane heater on a composite deck?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Plus, gas fire pits are designed to keep heat from going down. So, a gas-powered fire pit is typically OK on top of your composite decking.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_you_put_a_solo_stove_on_a_Trex_deck></span><strong>Can you put a solo stove on a Trex deck?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Solo Stoves are safe to use on both wood or Trex decking, provided you also use the Solo Stove stand or a heat resistant fire pit barrier underneath. Although Solo Stoves emit less heat than other types of fire pits, they could still damage your deck over prolonged periods of use.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_are_the_disadvantages_of_Trex_decking></span><strong>What are the disadvantages of Trex decking?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trex Decking Problems – Disadvantages of Composite Decking</p><ul><li>Mold and Mildew on Composite Decking.</li><li>Removing Snow or Ice from Composite Decking.</li><li>Color Fading on Composite Decking.</li><li>Trex Decking is Flaking.</li><li>Dealing with Static Electricity.</li><li>Chalk Line Residue.</li><li>Tannins on Trex Decking.</li><li>Damaged Decking.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Will_dogs_scratch_Trex_decking></span><strong>Will dogs scratch Trex decking?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There are three main ways to stop your dog from scratching the deck: make your dog wear booties, change your deck material, or train your pooch. Trex and composite decking will still scratch, but will show the scratches less visibly than treated wood decking.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Trex_decks_worth_it></span><strong>Are Trex decks worth it?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, worth it!</p><p>Yes, composite materials on decking and trim are worth the money. The labor to install composite is the same as the labor to install wood, which will rot and require a lot of maintenance. For example, the labor to replace a deck with Trex or wood might both be $4000.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_are_the_disadvantages_of_composite_decking></span><strong>What are the disadvantages of composite decking?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cons of Composite Decking</p><ul><li>A pricey alternative to wood. Durability comes at a cost, as composite decking is more expensive than wood.</li><li>Composites aren’t natural.</li><li>Composite decks aren’t completely maintenance free.</li><li>You’ll need to comparison shop.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Trex_decks_hot></span><strong>Are Trex decks hot?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>But how hot can composite decking get in the sun? One study found that in direct sunlight, composite decks can reach temperatures from 34° to 76° F hotter than the surrounding air. On an 80° day, that could mean a deck surface temperature of more than 150°.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Trex_decking_scratch_easily></span><strong>Does Trex decking scratch easily?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The short answer is yes. Trex decking features a hard shell that not only resists scratching but is also formulated to withstand long-term exposure to the elements with less maintenance than wood decking.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_restore_faded_Trex_decking></span><strong>How do you restore faded Trex decking?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You can perform a semiannual cleaning on your composite deck to preserve its longevity.</p><li>Step 1: Pre-spray your deck.</li><li>Step 2: Spray with soapy water & scrub.</li><li>Step 3: Rinse thoroughly.</li><li>Step 1: Pre-rinse.</li><li>Step 2: Mix up your vinegar solution.</li><li>Step 3: Sprinkle baking soda.</li><li>Step 4: Rinse thoroughly.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_repair_scratches_on_Trex_decking></span><strong>How do you repair scratches on Trex decking?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Here are some methods you can use to fix scratches on your composite deck:</p><li>Fill nicks and scratches with an epoxy-based filler and a putty knife.</li><li>Try the heat method.</li><li>Replace scratched boards with new ones.</li><li>Consider consulting the manufacturer or retailer about your scratched decking.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_my_composite_deck_turning_white></span><strong>Why is my composite deck turning white?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Probably the first thing a homeowner will notice is white spots on the deck. These are exposed wood particles bleached by the sun and rain. This is a sure sign that the deck’s seal has been damaged.</p><h2><strong></strong></h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><h3></h3><h3><strong></strong></h3><h2><strong></strong></h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1ktrR5yK1krJmWmnq1u4ybrKumXam%2FpsSMnZyco5mjtHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./collections.html><span>←</span><span>DJ Johnson | Fan Arch</span></a>
