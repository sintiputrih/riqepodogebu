<a href=../../../../msi-goes-compact-with-new-geforce-rtx-40series-gaming-slim-cards.html></a>
Modern graphics cards are notorious for their massive cooling systems and dimensions that are hard to fit into mainstream PC chassis and almost impossible to fit into compact PC cases that are rather popular among gamers. MSI this week attempted to address these concerns by announcing a family of GeForce RTX 40-series graphics cards called&nbsp;Gaming Slim&nbsp;that are meant to be slimmer than a typical add-in-board. But are they?
Judging by MSI's&nbsp;GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Gaming X Slim&nbsp;(which measures&nbsp;307×125×51 mm&nbsp;and weights 1086 grams), it is indeed considerably more compact than MSI's&nbsp;GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Gaming X Trio&nbsp;(337×140×62 mm @ 1594 grams).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>MSI's 300 Hz Gaming Laptops, the GS66 Stealth &amp;amp; GE66 Raider</h2><time>Jul 10, 2024</time>

In addition, MSI has an all-new compact GE66 Raider gaming notebook with panaramic aurora lighting and new internals. However, the main advantage of the new models over predecessors is its optional display panel with a 300 Hz refresh rate.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/58/>← Prev Page</a>
