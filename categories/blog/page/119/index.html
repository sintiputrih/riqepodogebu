Many men came here as soldiers
Many men will pass this way
Many men will count the hours
As they live the longest day
Many men are tired and weary
Many men are here to stay
Many men won't see the sunset
When it ends the longest day
The longest day the longest day
This will be the longest day
Filled with hopes and filled with fears
Filled with blood and sweat and tears</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bold and the Beautiful's Annika Noelle Teases Hope and Finn Romance</h2><time>Apr 9, 2024</time>
