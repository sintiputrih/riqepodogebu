Maybe, never say never,” she said on Quarantined with Bruce podcast. “But I couldn’t imagine being a mom now where I’m at as a mother, with my child at her first year, to have to be on a movie set that takes 14 hours, 16 hours of my day away from my child.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49tZpyZnZq%2FsLqMnaCasl2Zrrazx62cq2WilrGltddmqrChnWKwra3SrGSpoJ%2BpvHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashley-mcbryde-shows-off-weight-loss-at-cma-country-christmas.html><span>←</span><span>Ashley McBryde Shows Off Dramatic Weight Loss Transformation at CMA Country Christmas Special</span></a>
