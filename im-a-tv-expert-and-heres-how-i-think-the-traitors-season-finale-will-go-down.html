The drama, the suspicions, the wine-themed murders - it’s been the best. But now that the finale is almost upon us, I can’t wait to see whether the Faithfuls will be successful in rooting out all of the Traitors and splitting the cash prize - or if team Traitors will talk their way to winning the prize pot for themselves. So, with two episodes left to go, here’s how I think the finale will go down.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeNNCxUThRi data-wc=27>First of all, you have Thursday night’s episode, which will make some crucial decisions for the Faithfuls and the Traitors chances at taking home the big prize.&nbsp;</p><p id=edgHYifWKGJ data-wc=87>While Harry does appear to be out of the woods, with even Jaz no longer believing that he is a Traitor after the whole ‘fake attempted murder’ thing with the Shield, it looks like this season’s King of the Traitors might truly make it safely to the end - particularly if tonight’s murder turns out to the Jaz - as it truly will leave no one left with a hint of suspicion for Harry. That being said, I reckon that poor old Andrew won’t be joining him.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/14add9d0f3b3-harry-clark-the-traitors.jpg><p id=eG1ZIonONSe data-wc=52>Despite playing a very good game since the Traitor life chose him, Ross appears to have turned the Faithfuls suspicious of Andrew after ‘elusive-gate’. While Andrew denied Ross’s claims that he had called Harry ‘elusive’, Ross’s annoyance at the flagrant lie made him opt to vote for Andrew in the final roundtable.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The Traitors: Who is Harry Clark's girlfriend Anna Maynard?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/14add9d0f3b3-harry-clark-the-traitors.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The Traitors: Who is Harry Clark's girlfriend Anna Maynard?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The Traitors: Who is Harry Clark's girlfriend Anna Maynard?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I’ve deserted Love Island for The Traitors - here’s why" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/e9160f987521-claudia-traitors.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I’ve deserted Love Island for The Traitors - here’s why" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I’ve deserted Love Island for The Traitors - here’s why</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The Traitors' Diane is related to Endeavour star – details" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/96681b7dad35-traitors-diane.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The Traitors' Diane is related to Endeavour star – details" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The Traitors' Diane is related to Endeavour star – details</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=etX1uVBVeIU data-wc=70>His annoyance - particularly after the revelation that he was indeed a Traitor - has the Faithfuls confused - because although he was a Traitor, they believed that he was truly offended by Andrew denying that he had said anything of the sort. He might get away with it in the penultimate episode, but I can’t see the remaining Faithfuls trusting him enough to proclaim that the game is over.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a80f595fbe55-461407.jpg><p id=eydsPWvKMlCg data-wc=90>And if it isn’t the Faithfuls who are going to get Andrew out, it’s Harry. That boy does not want to split that prize fund, and with all of his tricks so far working perfectly, who are we to deny him one last betrayal? Whether it will take some persuasion from Harry, or Harry will refuse the game to end and force everyone to vote again to take out Andrew - we can’t see our favourite Welshman taking home the big prize now - no matter how he plays it.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">The Traitors season 2 contestants: Faithfuls and Traitors</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2f6eb6f1545f-459907.jpg><ul><li>Andrew - Faithful</li><li>Anthony - Faithful&nbsp;</li><li>Ash - Traitor</li><li>Aubrey - Faithful</li><li>Brian - Faithful</li><li>Charlie - Faithful</li><li>Charlotte - Faithful&nbsp;</li><li>Diane - Faithful</li><li>Evie - Faithful</li><li>Harry - Traitor</li><li>Jasmine - Faithful&nbsp;</li><li>Jaz - Faithful</li><li>Jonny - Faithful</li><li>Kyra - Faithful</li><li>Meg - Faithful</li><li>Miles - Traitor</li><li>Mollie - Faithful</li><li>Paul - Traitor</li><li>Ross - Faithful</li><li>Sonja - Potential Traitor</li><li>Tracey - Faithful&nbsp;</li><li>Zack - Faithful&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=eSUK6yETVOEi data-wc=90>So? Who is getting murdered before the show’s end? We’re going with Jaz and Zack. As for poor Jasmine? We don’t think she’ll be making it to the final either, as determined as Zack is that she is absolutely a Traitor, and in cahoots with Ross. So, I might be as clueless as the Faithfuls with these predictions, but I think we’ll be left with Andrew, Harry, Evie and Mollie as the finalists, with Andrew ultimately being voted out over the fire pit - and Harry taking home the prize.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cc474533a5d4-461382.jpg><p id=e9pGmiR5Smto data-wc=50>The more I think about it, the more I think a Traitors win is a total certainty - unless some serious twists are coming from Mollie and Evie. The pair are two of the roundtable’s quieter players, but they could just be keeping their cards very close to their chests.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e67cfee8b13e-460115.jpg><p id=e4pnnAAko3FS data-wc=111>Evie even alluded to there being more going on than we might think on Twitter, writing: “CAN I CLEAR SOMETHING UP. Being quiet is not the same as being clueless. You can be the loudest person in the room but are you saying anything?” So, after pretty much an all-boys club of traitoring throughout the series - can the girls sweep the rug out from beneath them both and win the prize? And is that even what we would want? After watching all of Harry’s hard work, I have to say I feel like he’s earned this £120k. But which will you be for the finale? Team Traitor, or Team Faithful?&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
