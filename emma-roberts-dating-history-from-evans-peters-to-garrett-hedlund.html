From <a href=#><strong>Alex Pettyfer</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Chord Overstreet</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Evan Peters</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Emma Roberts</strong></a>’ love life has made headlines since her teen years.</p><p>The Scream Queens alum sparked romance rumors with Peters <a href=#>after they met on the set of Adult World in 2012</a>. While viewers watched the duo work together in numerous seasons of <a href=#>American Horror Story</a>, There was <a href=#>even more drama offscreen</a>. Roberts <a href=#>was arrested in 2013 on domestic violence charges</a> after a fight with her boyfriend.</p><p>At the time, a rep for the pair told Us Weekly in a joint statement: “It was an unfortunate incident and misunderstanding. Ms. Roberts was released after questioning and the couple are working together to move past it.”</p><p>Although Roberts and Peters continued to date on and off, <a href=#>they officially called off their engagement in March 2019.</a></p><p>“Emma and Evan were heading for a split and now are just friends,” an insider told Us. “Evan has moved out. It wasn’t a bad breakup.”</p><p>Shortly after the split, multiple sources confirmed to Us that <a href=#>the former Nickelodeon star</a> had moved on with <strong><a href=#>Garrett Hedlund</a>.&nbsp;</strong>Two months after being spotted with the Tron: Legacy actor, the Nerve star opened up about <a href=#>having her dating life in the public eye.</a></p><p>“It’s hard enough to be with someone by yourself, let alone with an audience,” Roberts told Cosmopolitan in May 2019. “Growing up is hard. Sometimes it makes me sad that I can’t have a private moment. Because of Twitter and Instagram, there’s a whole other element where everybody can comment on what you’re doing, and no one knows the real story. That’s hard. … I know what’s true, and I know what happened in my own life, and so do the people that love me and who I love.”</p><p>In June 2020, Us exclusively revealed that Roberts and Hedlund <a href=#>were expecting their first child together.</a></p><p>“Emma and Garrett are getting more and more excited, which is so nice for them,” a source told Us at the couple. “Garrett is really looking forward to becoming a dad and feels as though this is something he needed. He is ready to take on all the daddy duties, and Emma getting pregnant has forced him to become more responsible. He thinks that’s a blessing.”</p><p><a href=#>After welcoming son Rhodes in December 2020</a>, the Holidate star reflected on the lessons she already learned as a new mother.</p><p>“It’s not something you’ll always feel like you’re getting right, but you will get better every day,” she told <a href=#><strong>Jamie Lee Curtis</strong></a> for Violet Grey in March 2021. “When in doubt, just love your child and yourself.”</p><p>The Modern Love alum, for his part, also <a href=#>gushed about getting to form a special connection with his little one.</a></p><p>“The best part is we were just in Boston, my gal, was working so it was every day all day with mister young man,” he told Extra in July 2021. “My favorite part of every day was the bedtime stories [with] me telling him stories of his grandfathers, which was wonderful for me and hopefully him. It was just a really sweet, connecting dad moment.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us confirmed that Roberts and Hedlund <a href=#>had called it quits in January 2022.</a></p><p>Scroll through to revisit the actress’ complete dating history:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksq65wGapqJqVp8G0ecOaq6Kml2K1qr%2FTqKmyZZanvK55xK%2BYp6tdpbK1sdGsZK2nXZyus77EratmoJWZuba6w2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./april-2023-horoscope-7373643.html><span>←</span><span>Your April Horoscope Is Here</span></a>
