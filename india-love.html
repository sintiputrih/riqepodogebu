<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>The Westbrooks star, India Love is a rapper, reality tv and Instagram star!</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>India Love</strong> is an American reality tv personality, rapper, and social media star. She has been in the spotlight since her teenage years. India first gained popularity after she created a Tumblr account back in 2011. Further, India's fame rose to prominence after she appeared in the BET's reality show, <i>'The Westbrooks'</i> alongside her sisters.</p><p>India was born on <i>February 3, 1996,</i> in California, the U.S &nbsp;to parents, <strong>Warren Westbrooks</strong> and <strong>Candy Westbrooks</strong>. The youngest of Westbrooks family, India has four sisters, <strong>Morgan</strong>, <strong>Brooke</strong>, <strong>Bree</strong>, and <strong>Crystal</strong>. Likewise, she has two brothers, <strong>Pop</strong> and <strong>Blake Westbrooks</strong>.</p><p>Many people want to know how is India Love in real life as she is known for her bad attitude from her reality tv show. Also, she is known for dating several men. So, is that true? Let's find out.</p><h2>India Love Relationship Status</h2><p>Well, gergious India is currently single at the moment. However she has been linked with numerous men in the past, just like <a href=#>Alexis Skyy</a>. When asked if she is bothered by such news, India told that she likes to keep people guessing.

Addressing the claims, India <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>told</strong></a> Rolling Out:</p><p>“Another thing people get wrong is that I’ve dated all of these men. That’s probably the No. 1 thing that people have gotten wrong about me… But just because I might take a photo with a guy doesn’t mean that I’m dating him, f**king him, or none of that shit. That just means that I’m getting to know the person, having a good time, and wanted to share it with the world.”</p><p>India is now more concerned with her own well being. She doesn't prefer to share intimate details about her personal life. However, she has no problem sharing raunchy images on social media. We just have to wait and see if she will marry soon or will make a boyfriend.</p><h2>Became a Victim of Bullying</h2><p>It is inspiring to know that India who spreads self-love and motivation through her songs was once a victim of severe bullying.
