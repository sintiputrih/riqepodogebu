Source: Cleveland</p><h2><span id=Denver_Broncos>Denver Broncos</span></h2><p>Denver Broncos selected Peyton&nbsp;Hillis with the 20th pick in the seventh round, i.e. 227th overall of the 2008 NFL Draft. He also received his college number, i.e. 22.</p><p>At the start of the 2008 season, the Broncos listed him as its fullback. Then he played in his first NFL regular-season game on 8 September 2008.</p><p>He gained 14 yards on three rushing attempts and four yards on one reception as part of a 41–14 Broncos road victory over the Oakland Raiders.</p><p>Later in the season, he recorded his first career 100-yard receiving game with seven catches for 116 yards and a touchdown in a 26–17 Broncos home loss to the Miami Dolphins on November 2, 2008.</p><p>Following an injury to Ryan Torain in the Broncos’ 34–30 comeback road victory over the Cleveland Browns, he has been named Denver’s starting running back.</p><p>Two weeks later, he recorded his first 100-yard rushing game with 129 yards and a touchdown on 22 attempts in a 34–17 road victory over the New York Jets.</p><p>However, the season already plagued with running back injuries continued, with him suffering a season-ending injury in a 24–17 home win over the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><h4>Game details with Broncos</h4><p>Coming down from an acrobatic catch of a Cutler pass, he was hit from both sides by Chiefs’ free safety Jarrad Page and cornerback Brandon Carr. He had his right foot planted.</p><p>The hit doubled Hillis over, causing a 2–3 inches tear in his right hamstring behind the knee, which forced him to miss the rest of the season.</p><p>Despite his limited playing time, he ended the 2008 season as the Broncos’ leading rusher with 343 yards and 5 touchdowns and was expected to return as a significant offensive presence for the 2009 season.</p><p>He expressed his disappointment over his playing time on the season. He did so during a post-season interview. However, he remained tight-lipped about the controversy, maintaining that conversations between him and McDaniels were “friendly”.</p><p>In the same interview, he was quoted as saying his future in Denver was “up in the air”. On 14 March 2010, the Broncos traded him to the Cleveland Browns along with a sixth-round pick in the 2011 Draft and a conditional pick in the 2012 Draft.</p><p>They traded him in exchange for quarterback Brady Quinn.</p><h2><span id=Cleveland_Browns>Cleveland Browns</span></h2><p>During the 2010 preseason, the Browns distributed snaps evenly between Peyton Hillis, Jerome Harrison, James Davis, Chris Jennings, and Montario Hardesty. His best pre-season rushing game came in Week 2 against the St. Louis Rams.</p><p>While getting the majority of the snaps, he ran for 51 yards on 12 carries (4.3 ypc).</p><p>As the regular season began, his start in Cleveland began much the same way as it did in Denver. He listed down the depth chart at both tight end and fullback.</p><p>Just like his start in Denver, his early-season injuries and another to Davis thrust him into the starting spot for the Week 3 game versus the Baltimore Ravens.</p><p>Their result was a 144-yard romp against the Ravens’ staunch rushing defense, which allowed just 3.4 yards per carrying in the 2009 season.</p><p>The next week, he again ran for over 100 yards at home against the Cincinnati Bengals. This led the Browns to their first victory in the 2010 regular season. He suffered a thigh injury in practice and hence this limited him in Week 5 against the Atlanta Falcons.</p><p>Nevertheless, he added a 19-yard reception for a touchdown, making him the first Browns player since Greg Pruitt to record touchdowns in five consecutive games.</p><p>Moreover, coming off a bye week in Week 8, he set career marks in both rushing and all-purpose yards against the New England Patriots in Week 9. They finished the game with 184 rushing yards (6.5 ypc) and 220 yards of total offense.</p><p>Following this game, he was named “AFC Offensive Player of the Week” for Week 9. It was the first Cleveland&nbsp;Browns running back to win that honor since Eric Metcalf in 1992.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-33307 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Peyton-Hillis-playing.jpg alt="Peyton Hillis" width=650 height=495 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-33307 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Peyton Hillis playing the game for the team Cleveland Brown. Source: Bleacher Report</p><h4>More insights with Cleveland</h4><p>Similarly, in week 12, he joined Marshall Faulk as the only player to have achieved more than 130 yards rushing, 3 rushing touchdowns, and 60 yards receiving in a single game.</p><p>Then on 12 December 2010, he went over the 1,000-yard mark on an 8-yard rush. He became the first white running back to rush for over 1,000 yards in an NFL season since Craig James of the New England Patriots in 1985.</p><p>Due to his breakout season, he was the Browns finalist in the Madden NFL 12 cover vote. After defeating Ray Rice, Matt Ryan, and Super Bowl MVP Aaron Rodgers, he advanced to the finals where he faced off against Michael Vick.</p><p>On 27 April 2011, they announced him as the cover athlete for the game, beating out Vick with 66 percent of the vote.</p><p>Further, he had a difficult 2011–12 season. This led him to be associated with the Madden Curse, a history of poor performance by athletes after appearing on the Madden cover. The season began with unsuccessful negotiations to extend his contract.</p><p>He had a good game in a Week 2 match-up with the Indianapolis Colts, running for 94 yards and 2 touchdowns, but he then sat out a game the next week against the Miami Dolphins with strep throat on the advice of his agent.</p><p>Similarly, he then injured his hamstring 2 times. Once in a game and once in practice. This limited his performance and in turn, this frustrated his teammates.</p><p>He rebounded towards the end of the season, rushing for 99 yards in Arizona and 112 in Baltimore to finish with 587 and 3 touchdowns. At the end of the year, he stated he wanted to re-sign with the Browns, even willing to offer a hometown discount.</p><p>However, the Browns never made him an offer. They allowed him to leave as a free agent to Kansas City.</p><h2><span id=Other_teams>Other teams</span></h2><p>On the 14th of March 2012, Peyton Hillis signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. He finished the 2012 season with 309 yards on 85 carries as a backup to Jamaal Charles. On July 23, 2013, Hillis signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><p>It was announced on September 21, 2013, that Hillis had been released by the Buccaneers. His Buccaneers career ended with one game active, no carries no catches, and no offensive yards.</p><p>On 16 October 2013, the New York Giants announced they had signed him for the 2013–14 season. On 11 March 2014, the Giants gave him a $1.8 million contract extension for two more years.</p><p>Before the start of the 2014 season, Hillis agreed to change his number from #44 to #33, so that rookie Andre Williams could wear the number he wore in college.</p><p>He wore #33 while he was in training camp with the Buccaneers. Then on 25 February 2015, the Giants announced the release of Hillis.</p><h4>Retirement</h4><p>Peyton retired in 2015, at his doctor’s behest due to his history of concussions and the potential of future injury. He also claimed in an interview, “As far as NFL football goes, my heart’s just not in it anymore.”</p><p>After his retirement in 2015, he appeared on the NFL talk show titled “Peyton’s Places”. He was the host of the show in the year 2019.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Peyton Hillis is a <strong>married</strong> man and his wife is Amanda Brown. The lovers tied the knot on 24 October 2011. Similarly, they have a son named Orry who was born in June 2013.</p><p>The family lives on their 1,300-acre soybean farm in southwestern Tennessee. Moreover, he endorsed Ron Paul during the 2012 presidential election.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-33313 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Peyton-Hillis-family.jpg alt="Peyton Hillis" width=650 height=432 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-33313 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Peyton Hillis with his wife and so on.
