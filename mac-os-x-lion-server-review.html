<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Server.app and Server Admin Overview</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Let’s start with Server.app, since it’s going to be the administration tool we’ll use the most throughout this review. I’ll start with a general overview of what it is and what it does, and then I’ll move on to the specific services that it manages.</p>In the sidebar under Accounts, we can see an overview of user accounts and user groups, both those that are local to the server and (if you’re hosting a directory) managed network accounts and groups. From here, you can create users and groups, edit group membership, allow users and groups to administer the server, and edit some other basic user attributes.<p>For small and/or uncomplicated directories, Server.app will be fine for managing your directory, though people wanting to do anything more advanced will want to be familiar with Workgroup Manager (one of the Server Admin Tools that we’ll discuss in depth later).</p><p>Moving down the sidebar, our next entries are Alerts and Stats under the Status heading. Alerts is a simple log viewer, showing you messages about your server that you should know (if you have Server.app in your dock, the number of Alerts you have will be displayed with the icon).</p>Stats, as its name implies, will give you some simple statistics about CPU, RAM, and network bandwidth usage. This worked intermittently on my test servers, and <a href=#>at least one Apple Support thread suggests that this isn’t uncommon</a> - this is the sort of thing that usually gets fixed in a point update.<p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4547/stats_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p>Next, under Services, is a full list of every service manageable by Server.app - most of these offer up big on-off switches (I can hear seasoned admins grinding their teeth at this) and some basic configuration options which vary from service to service - we’ll talk more about the available options for each service as we discuss them.<p>Last up is the Hardware section, which lets you do quite a few things. The Overview tab gives you basic information about your server’s hardware and uptime.<br></p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4547/hardware_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Under the Settings tab, you can enable and disable SSH and remote administration of your server, create and control SSL certificates, and “dedicate system resources to server services,” which enhances the performance of some server functions at the expense of “the performance of some user applications” (this would be a useful box to tick on a dedicated server, but not on a personal computer that’s doing double-duty as a workstation).</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4547/hardware-settings_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p>Under the Network tab, you can see your server’s various network interfaces and their IP addresses, and you can also change your server’s host name (which is nice, since changing the host name used to require digging around in Server Admin and/or some command line trickery, depending on what you were doing).<p>Lastly, the Storage tab gives you an overview of your available disk space, and also allows you to change the access permissions on files and folders (useful if you have file-sharing enabled, though you should probably do this using the File Sharing service itself, since it is much better at it).<br></p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4547/hardware-storage_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Lastly, at the bottom of the screen, you can see something called Next Steps - this is an excellent place for novices to figure out what to do now that they’ve setup a server. It will guide you through setting up your network, managing network accounts, managing devices, and starting services, among a few other things. Those needing more advanced help can go through <a href=#>the documentation for Lion Server</a> - the page is looking a little sparse right now, especially when compared to the extensive documentation for previous OS X Server versions, but hopefully it will become a little more populated over time.</p><p>Lastly, let’s talk about remote administration - if your OS X servers are located in a server room where you don’t have physical access to them, you’ll need a way to manage them remotely. In past OS X Server versions, the Server Admin Tools were installable to any OS X client, and enabled remote administration of most services and tasks.</p><p>Server.app, however, is not available for client OS X versions - if you need to administer Lion Server remotely, you’ll either need to change your OS X client into a server (thus giving you access to Server.app, which can be used to connect to other servers), or you must control your servers directly using VNC or Screen Sharing or Apple Remote Desktop (take your pick). It’s not a deal-breaking change, but businesses (whose Lion licensing terms are a bit less generous than those for consumers) will have to cough up for additional Server licenses if they want their admins to administer services on their servers.</p><p>We’ll look at the individual Server.app services soon - first, I want to walk you through the Server Admin program and OS X Server’s directory services, since so many of the other services are dependent on them.</p><h3>Server Admin Overview</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As we talked about before, Server Admin used to be the heart of OS X Server. Its role in Lion, while much reduced, is still important, since it still manages some of the software’s more interesting pieces.</p><p>Download the Server Admin Tools from the Apple download site, install them, and fire up Server Admin. After authenticating, you should see the following:</p><br><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4547/server-admin_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You won’t be able to see any services to manage at the start - to view them, click the Settings button, go to the Services tab, check everything you want to configure on the server, click Save, and the services will become available in the left sidebar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4547/server-admin-services_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>&nbsp;</p>You can also use Server Admin to setup email alerts about your server, view detailed logs, apply updates to your server, specify access and administrative access to specific services and a few more advanced administrative functions that Server.app doesn’t offer - there’s too much here to go through it all blow by blow, but poke around some and you can see everything there is to see.<p>Server Admin can still be installed to Lion clients and used to administer Lion Server (and Snow Leopard Server) remotely.</p><p>Now, time to talk about some services.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIF2gJZopJqbXaTAbsSMpaCopl2osrPCxKtkq52mnrK4e5M%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./25807-lana-del-reys-shades-of-cool-is-the-most-honest-dangerous-love-song-ever-listen.html><span>←</span><span>Lana Del Rey's &amp;quot;Shades of Cool&amp;quot; is the Most Honest Dangerous Love Song Ever LISTEN</span></a>
