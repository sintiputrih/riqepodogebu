Is she OK? Here’s a health update.</h2><p>Following her on-screen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">health scare</a>, Alissa took to social media to assure fans that she was OK. “Thanks for all the calls, texts, and well wishes,” she wrote in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> post. Later, she revealed that she had been released from the hospital, where she was treated for a head injury.</p><p>Alissa joined <a href=#>Gayle King</a> on <a href=#>CBS Mornings</a> on Tuesday, March 21. During their interview, the meteorologist shared what really happened on Saturday. “In the morning, I felt fine,” she said.</p><p>“It wasn't really up until about 15 minutes prior to the incident that I started to feel a little [nauseous] and at that point, I went to the restroom and thought, 'OK, I'll be fine, I'll get through the hit and I'll get something to eat,'” adding that she had skipped breakfast that morning.</p><p>“I also had been drinking a lot of coffee and so most likely I was maybe a little dehydrated.”</p><p>Despite feeling sick, Alissa pushed on and attempted to “power through” her segment.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Instead, she ended up being rushed to the hospital. According to Alissa, she was previously diagnosed with a condition called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vasovagal syncope</a>, which was what caused her to pass out on air.</p><p>“It hadn't happened in a while and I'm now going to have to learn how to really recognize the symptoms of this condition,” Alissa added.</p><p>As of this writing, Alissa is on a temporary leave of absence, however, the CBS Los Angeles meteorologist assured fans that she’d return to the small screen after spending some time in recovery.</p><p>“Sometimes we put ourselves last. We go, go, go until something happens,'” she said. But Alissa won’t be making that mistake again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@schwartz.alissa</a><p>Alissa Carlson Schwartz</p></figure><p>After all, this isn’t the first time she’s had issues with her health while on set.

In fact, Alissa said her heart is doing “great” these days, and we love that for her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforK1sc6rpqWnl57AtXnApaCsq5FisKK%2By6ymp2WjmLW4rdGtsWaglZa5tbQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-natasha-richardsons-ex-husband-robert-fox-2.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Natasha Richardsons Ex-Husband Robert Fox?</span></a>
