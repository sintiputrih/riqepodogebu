It's not a juvenile delinquent facility. We're not in criminal justice. We're educators. So, when our students are struggling behaviorally, we have to teach them the right behaviors. When children can't read, we teach them how to read. When children can't behave, we have the same responsibility to teach them how to behave," Dr. Arcurio told 6 News.<p>Another big change: the school switched their security company to Gardaworld.</p><p>This year, there will be 12 security officers throughout the district, along with a School Resource Officer in each school building.</p><p>The SROs will come from the Johnstown Police Department.</p><p>The last change to announce: every student in the middle and high school will go through a metal detector and 'wanding' every day.</p><p>Dr. Arcurio says students will be screened when entering their school building, along with all athletic facilities for games.</p><p>She says, last school year, students were only screened at 'random' due to a lack of security staff.</p>It's not a response to just our community, but it's really a recognition and a response to the world today. It requires us to be incredibly vigilant in making sure that those spaces are incredibly safe for our students and staff," Dr. Arcurio told 6 News.<p>Greater Johnstown School District leaders are also focusing on prevention rather than just reaction.</p><p>Dr. Arcurio says they need "mental detectors" in addition to metal detectors.</p><p>In recent years, they've hired more mental health staff, including social workers, mental health professionals, behavioral health specialists, and therapists.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7y6iamqRfo7K4edKemq6qmanGbrnEmqquqpWoeqLAjKChrJxdnrukuNSdoKefXaOyuHnApaueqp6WwarCxGacna2TlsGqu82ao2aonJawprnEp6tmmqWeuaW1zaA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./820203-draya-michele-sues-tyrod-taylor-gossip-news.html><span>←</span><span>Draya Michele Sues Tyrod Taylor For Alleged Eviction Threats After Home Deal Goes South</span></a>
