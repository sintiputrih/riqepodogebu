I recently had the chance to chat with Gourley, Carter, McConville, and musician James Bladon, who did an oustanding job of turning the gang’s funny songs into authentic-sounding country tunes. We discussed the new album, future Superego plans, and how Matt Gourley came into the possession of Waco cult leader David Koresh’s guitar.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0nrmzl12zlkv84pypj1fld@published data-word-count=8><strong>How did you guys meet each other originally?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0nrmzl12zmkv84mz4kmvb7@published data-word-count=37><strong>Matt Gourley: </strong>We were in a comedy group called ComedySportz.

We had this ridiculous job where we were paid – this is gonna sound really weird – but a bunch of us were paid to fly first class because some company found a loophole where they could earn more frequent flier points doing these flights, so they’d pay people like us fifty dollars a round trip to fly to Las Vegas or San Francisco. We’d do like three legs in a day, three round trips. Then, we’d hang out and watch World War II movies together.

We just got together and recorded – not even on a computer – on a digital 8-track and didn’t really know what we were doing. [We] kind of learned along the way, built a website, put it on iTunes. Nobody was listening for the longest time, which was probably a good thing ‘cause we felt like we could just do any kind of comedy we wanted. We weren’t thinking anybody would listen to it, so we had no censors or inhibitions.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0nrmzl1306kv8479fosbvr@published data-word-count=10><strong>Do you remember what the first stuff you recorded was?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0nrmzl1307kv84pqn2caab@published data-word-count=22><strong>Gourley:</strong> Yeah, it’s basically on the first episode of Superego.

But also, that Mutt Taylor stuff existed before Superego. We just kind of needed material. We weren’t really producing a ton, so we just threw that on there because it kind of fit in.

I love doing it but I don’t always love taking it out to the public, and this was a way that made me love doing it because you could just have a lot more fun with it; you didn’t have to take it as seriously. I really liked playing guitar and writing songs, and I guess I’ve been playing guitar for 20 years now? Jesus. Oh my God. I like recording music a lot, and I’ve had a couple bands in the past. Just little folk groups, but nothing serious.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0nrmzm1339kv840urb5xcf@published data-word-count=97><strong>Carter:</strong> I basically learned all the open chords when I was a kid, and I didn’t touch a guitar until about a year and a half ago, so I didn’t play guitar for 25 years.

I’m a big Rolling Stones fan; went through a big Elton John phase when I was younger.&nbsp; I just always liked that ‘60s, ‘70s, ‘80s rock, and in the last year and a half, I’ve learned to play the guitar because I really enjoy it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0nrmzm133akv84z1gt86l7@published data-word-count=53><strong>Gourley:</strong> I should mention to that I once bought – I still have it – but I bought a vintage electric guitar, and it turned out to be David Koresh, the Waco, Texas cult leader, owned it.
