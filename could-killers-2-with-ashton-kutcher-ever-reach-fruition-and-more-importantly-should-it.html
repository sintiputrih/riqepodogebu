Shortly after it hit the silver screen, allegations of infidelity involving Ashton and his then-wife, Demi Moore, found their way into the pages of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Magazine</a>. He responded by publishing a strongly worded denial on social media.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I think Star magazine calling me a "cheater" qualifies as defamation of character.

However, the bad press generated good box office for the star. Despite&nbsp;Killers’&nbsp;flimsy plot and lack of originality, the movie earned a global gross of $98.1 million against a production budget of $75 million. Ashton’s appeal and the scandal surrounding him played a pivotal role in its achievement</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Controversy is King</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ashton-Kutcher-and-Danny-Masterson.jpg><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>Fast forward to 2023, and a fresh scandal involving Ashton and his current wife, Mila Kunis. The couple is facing a backlash from the public due to their contentious letters&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seeking leniency</a>&nbsp;for Danny Masterson. Like clockwork,&nbsp;Killers&nbsp;has found its audience, baffling critics who universally panned the movie. Once again, his magnetism and a media debacle drive interest in the film. Its resurgence poses the intriguing question: might Ashton return for a sequel?</p><h2 id=h-what-is-killers-about data-injectable=false>What Is Killers About?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ashton-kitcher-kathless-heigl.png><p data-characters=880 data-current-count=1180 data-injectable=true>Killers&nbsp;tells the story of Jen Kornfeldt (Katherine Heigl), a woman who travels to the sun-drenched shores of southern France to recover from a difficult break-up. During the trip, she falls in love with Spencer Aimes (Kutcher), the man of her dreams. They marry and settle down in an picturesque suburb. However, an attempted murder shatters their idyllic life, and Spencer must come clean about his past. He reveals he is a professional assassin and lets Jen know there is a bounty on him.&nbsp;Killers&nbsp;is a chronicle of clichés told with astonishingly awful dialogue. Case in point: “Let’s just say I work for the blah blah blah, and they gave me a license to blah.” Ironically, “blah” was critics’ go-to descriptor to warn viewers about the perceived mind-numbing tedium of&nbsp;Killers. Yet, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">despite the lambasting</a>, the movie did surprisingly well.</p><h2 id=h-the-comfort-of-simplicity-amid-life-s-complexities data-injectable=false>The Comfort of Simplicity Amid Life’s Complexities</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/killers-2010-1.jpg><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>Killers&nbsp;is an unpretentious action-comedy that offers the simple pleasures of laughter and love amid some high-octane scenes. Like Ashton Kutcher, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katherine Heigl was a household name in 2010</a>, ensuring that the movie would at least pique the interest of film lovers. Then as now, it was released in a time of economic instability and the film’s predictability was just what the doctor ordered.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>Killers‘&nbsp;endgame is not social commentary or profound insights into human nature. Its sole mission is to entertain. It is a star-driven film willing to meet the needs of movie fans who like a bit of levity now and then.</p><h2 id=h-why-killers-captivates-audiences data-injectable=false>Why Killers Captivates Audiences</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ashoton_kutcher_killers.png><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Killers’&nbsp;success never fails to baffle the naysayers because they don’t understand the cinematic palate of some rom-com fans. Ashton’s razor-sharp business acumen makes it easy to forget that a film like&nbsp;Killers&nbsp;is on-brand for him because it’s silly fun with a good-looking guy. What’s not to like?</p><p data-characters=804 data-current-count=1148 data-injectable=true>A simple glance at Ashton’s IMdB movie credits reveals a pattern in the roles that helped him ascend to stardom: beautiful moron Jesse Montgomery in&nbsp;Dude, Where’s My Car?;&nbsp;daft hunk Kelso on&nbsp;That 70s Show; and pretty boy prankster-in-chief on&nbsp;Punk’d.&nbsp;Movie fans seem unconcerned with the substance of his films because back in 2010, Ashton was shamelessly self-indulgent eye candy whether he wore a trucker hat or a tuxedo. He was the real-life version of the character Drew Baird (Jon Hamm) from the “The Bubble” episode of&nbsp;30 Rock. Thus, his audience is content with feel-good escapism wrapped in a handsome yet relatable package. No matter how absurd and derivative his movies are, Ashton invariably ends up laughing all the way to the bank.</p><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>For this reason, despite being savaged by critics,&nbsp;Killers&nbsp;enjoyed moderate success at the box office. The film earned $15.8 million during its opening weekend due to the popularity of its lead actor. At the time, Ashton was half of a Hollywood power couple and a prominent presence on the hottest social media app back in 2010, Twitter. Even amidst negative press, seeing him continues to evoke fond memories for his fans, who are shame-watching&nbsp;Killers&nbsp;in droves despite his ethically elastic support of Masterson.</p><h2 id=h-conclusion data-injectable=false>Conclusion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kathleen-heigl-ashton-kutcher-killers2010.png><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>Killers’&nbsp;ability to become the second most-watched film on Netflix may present an economic opportunity. The film has an audience, and its newfound popularity suggests Ashton’s pretty privilege is undiminished by scandals, low scores on Rotten Tomatoes, and Father Time. Earlier this year, he starred in&nbsp;Your Place Or Mine,&nbsp;so he is still an engaging romantic lead despite his dad status and high-flying career as a venture capitalist. A sequel to&nbsp;Killers&nbsp;could happen.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>But is there truly a need for a&nbsp;Killers 2?&nbsp;Those who view the original film as unapologetic escapist nonsense would say once was enough. However, even viewers who enjoyed the film might agree that it has already squeezed every last drop from the proverbial lemon.</p><p data-characters=37 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>Killers&nbsp;is streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqitnJl6rLXLpZyrq11neri106FkmquYqbyvecquq5yglad6psLEq2SrnZGYtW6y0a6graGfo3qiusNmpKiqlWK2rrzOq6uapqShxm6%2Fx6ispZxdnsFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brittani-louise-taylor-net-worth-131888.html><span>←</span><span>Brittani Louise Taylor Net Worth</span></a>
