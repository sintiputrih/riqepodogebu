The preview gave viewers a glimpse of what is to come in the new season. It especially highlighted&nbsp;Sam Logan and Juliette Porter’s break-up story. And following the teaser release when Sam wished one of his co-stars, from the new season, a ‘Happy Birthday’ this got some fans hoping her not to be his new girlfriend and while the others seemed pleased with the idea of them dating.</p><p>The rumored girlfriend is Jordana Barnes and fans should remember her from the previous season as well.</p><p>Find out more as you take a trip down to ‘Jordana Barnes Bio’ with brand-new episodes premiering on MTV on 10 March 2022.</p><h3><strong>Siesta Key: Is Sam Logan Jordana Barnes Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Without knowing what is actually the deal fans have divided over Jordana Barnes’ romance with Sam Logan. So now, let us get into what actually transpired between them for fans to make all these speculations.</p><p>Sam and Juliette’s love was still blossoming. It had only been a little over a year since they started dating when Jordana Barnes came into the picture. This is Siesta Key‘s third season we are talking about.</p><p>Sam invited Juliette, a friend of his, who is also an artist to get&nbsp;Juliette’s portrait made. Coincidently, Juliette shares a history with Sam.</p><p>After Sam’s split with ex Brittany Russell, he and Jordana had “hooked up”.</p><p>Juliette was clearly not pleased when she knew about this. She instead had steered her focus to discussing the artwork.</p><p>Other than Sam, Jordana also seemed to be good friends with Madisson Hausburg and Kelsey Owens.</p><p>With that being said, it is still not clear if over the course Sam became her boyfriend.</p><p>In the meantime, some of the fans feel like Jordana is just Sam’s “side piece” and that they are pretending to be in love with seemingly “forced” kisses.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Jordana Barnes Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Jordana Barnes reportedly acquired above $400 thousand as net worth as of February 2022.</p><p>Professionally, she is a self-taught artist who deals with TV prints and famous portraits. (This explains why her costar Sam was splurging $10K on the painting.)</p><p>Jordana has been working as a self-employed artist since May 2017.</p><p>Speaking of her education, we only knew that she went to Booker High School and graduated in 2010.</p><p>And so you know, last year in Siesta Key was her first time filming. IMDB, however, still had not listed her as the cast of the reality show.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Jordana Barnes?</strong></h3><p>Because Jordana Barnes was born in 1992, she turned 30 early in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Jordana Barnes Height</strong></h3><p>Beautiful Jordana stands below 5’4” tall in height. She really was pleasing to the eyes in all her Siesta Key shots last year. Some of us especially loved her long, flattened honey-blonde hair. Though lately, she styled it shoulder-length and kept it natural and dye free.</p><h3><strong>What Happened To Jordana Barnes Brother?</strong></h3><p>Jordana Barnes’ brother Brenden Barnes passed away before he turned 21 on 21 January 2011. Brenden was 15 and Jordana was 18, on what Jordana tells to be the worst day of her life. She said remember everything about that day like it was yesterday, especially the last hug she gave him.</p><p>Brenden’s death involved a fatal hit and run case that was all over the local magazine the next day.</p><p>Kim Marie Leto, a 50-year-old, had struck Brenden and likely his friend, who were in the westbound bike lane along Whitfield Avenue near Tuttle Avenue in Florida, at about 10:30 p.m. on a Saturday night.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Jordana Barnes’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>Jordana Barnes’ parents are Rosa Lewis and Robert Barnes. They are no longer together. They were already separated when they lost their son in the accident.</p><p>Jordana’s mom has ever since been married to Michael Lewis.</p><p>Robert also seemed to have married again. According to his Facebook, he is the owner of “My Own Company”, went to Madison Area Memorial High School, lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, and is from Madison, Maine.</p><p>Other people in Jordana’s family are her grandmother, Carey (Oded Clopet), grandfather, Robert Barnes, uncles Ben and Gilberto, and aunt Sofia.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Jordana Barnes Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Every year the 22nd of February marks Jordana’s birthday making her a Pisces.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Jordana Barnes From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jordana Barnes hails from her hometown of Los Angeles, California. But she and her family have been living in Sarasota, Florida for a while now.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Jordana Barnes Ethnicity?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jordana speaks splendid Spanish and from the look of her social media she also likely has some Mexican roots.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Jordana Barnes On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes. Jordana could be found on Instagram <a href=#>@jordanalexus_</a> and as of 24 February 2022, she entertained 30 posts<br>69.6K followers on it.</p><p>Jordana also occasionally posted on Twitter <a href=#>@jordana_barnes</a> and ‘Jordan Barnes’ <a href=#>Facebook</a>.</p><p>At last, let us also tell you that Jordana’s real name is actually ‘Jordan’ and her full name is ‘Jordan Alexis Barnes’. However, everywhere including her social media she prefers to go by ‘Jordana’. This was revealed during a <a href=#>Reddit conversation</a> which also outed a not-so-good fact about Jordana. She had got arrested likely for speeding in Sarasota on the 4th of August 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmo6eima6vrYybmKumlah6o7XOZpmrp6SdsrN5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpeceeoKCgpGLAqrHSrZhmo5WufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marion-davies-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Marion Davies Net Worth</span></a>
