The star is worth an impressive $14 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, and it didn't take his medical degree to get him there!&nbsp;</p><p>Jeong has been a panelist on <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a> since 2019, per <a href=#>IMDb</a>, also having joined as <a href=#>a panelist on&nbsp;The Masked Dancer in late 2020</a>. There's no doubt that the Fox reality shows are definitely bringing him the big bucks!&nbsp;According to <a href=#>Variety</a>,&nbsp;in 2020, Jeong may have been "the most ubiquitous face on Fox ... the centerpiece of what Fox has now jokingly dubbed 'Kensday,' a Wednesday lineup that includes both Masked Singer, where he serves as a panelist, and I Can See Your Voice, which he hosts."&nbsp;And that's on top of his already solid resume. Impressive!</p><p>Real estate-wise, Jeong purchased an estate in Calabasas, Calif. in 2016 for $3.95 million. According to <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>, the "Tudor-style" mansion has 6,700 square feet of living space, "two offices, a private screening room, and a modern chef's kitchen with a French Lacanche range." It also includes "a custom temperature-controlled wine cellar can hold as many as 3,000 bottles." Cheers!&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, Jeong listed another Calabasas, Calif. home for $2.5 million per <a href=#>Cottages & Gardens</a>, theoretically to upgrade to his massive, earlier-mentioned home. We can't think of many stars who deserve such success (on-screen and at the bank) more than Ken Jeong!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG1ha4Jze8qepWailaS7qL%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jK2fnmWTpLqmsMiapWaho2LEsL7ToWSmp6KaerW0wKdksqelYsGptc2kZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miley-cyrus-tartan-mini-skirt-fishnets-garter-snl-rehearsal-see-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Miley Cyrus Rocks A Tartan Mini Skirt, Fishnets, &amp;amp; Garter At Rehearsal Hollywood Life</span></a>
