WWE’s Chief Creative Officer made his presence known on RAW this week, and he had quite a reason to be there, as a new Title Belt needed to be revealed.</p><p><a href=#>Click here for our complete coverage of WWE RAW this week</a></p><p>Triple H revealed a new title belt this week on RAW. This was actually expected, because early rumors and backstage talk said that this belt was on the way.</p><p>Triple H started out by talking about how Roman Reigns has held his title for almost 1,000 days at this point. That led to Triple H saying that Roman Reigns was smart by getting himself into a position where he didn’t have to defend his title as often. That’s great for Roman Reigns, but not for WWE.</p><p>That is when Triple H said that the WWE Draft will change WWE at its very core, because Roman Reigns will stay on whichever brand he gets drafted to while the other brand will determine a new champion.</p><p>On Saturday, May 27th at Night of Champions, WWE will crown a new World Heavyweight Champion. Then Triple H revealed a new title, and it looked amazing. This drew a very positive reaction from the Chicago crowd as well.</p><p><a href=#>As we previously reported,</a> CM Punk was asked to leave WWE RAW this week, but he was backstage for while. Punk reportedly got to see several members of the roster and also talk to Triple H. It was also reported <a href=#>exactly who asked CM Punk to leave.</a> Some WWE Superstars also believe that <a href=#>CM Punk only showed up to hype his AEW return.</a></p><p>What’s your take on this new title belt during WWE RAW this week?
