Police say he could not negotiate a curve, and the bike slammed into the embankment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Williams, a fighter known as "The Punisher," is from Aiken, S.C. He was in metro Atlanta to attend his brother's wedding.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; He was scheduled to fight Saul "Canelo" Alvarez on Sept. 15 in Las Vegas but that event has been canceled, Peterson said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Williams is among the most versatile and unusual athletes in boxing, making him a highly undesirable opponent for the world's best fighters during his lengthy, successful career. He has competed effectively in an impressive three weight classes against much shorter foes, even comfortably making the 147-pound welterweight limit despite his lanky 6-foot-2 frame.</p><p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph body-copyright">WSOC</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaJqfrbKzedKcZKmZopa5usbEnWSanqSav265zq2mq5upmLmmedarnJyjX2h%2FeoORbG1pb18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./walter-wynia-accident-linked-to-death-family-mourns.html><span>←</span><span>Walter Wynia Accident Linked To Death Cause Family Mourns The Loss</span></a>
