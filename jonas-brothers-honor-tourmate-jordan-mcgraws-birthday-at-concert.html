The Jonas Brothers went all out to make their tourmate <strong>Jordan McGraw</strong>’s birthday extra special during their second stop at the Hollywood Bowl on Monday, October 21.</p><p>The trio and their wives interrupted McGraw, <a href=#><strong>Dr. Phil</strong></a>’s son, in the midst of his set to surprise the “Met At a Party” crooner with a cake on his big day. The crowd then sang “Happy Birthday” to McGraw along with the band.</p><p>On Instagram, McGraw noted that this was his “best birthday maybe ever tonight at the Hollywood Bowl.” He then <a href=#>gave a special “thank you” to the Jonas Brothers</a> for their efforts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jonas-Brothers-Surprise-Tourmate-Jordan-McGraw-With-Birthday-Cake-02.jpg><p>In August, McGraw told <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a> that opening up for the Jonas Brothers “really is the happiness begins tour.” He also said it’s “like high school.”</p><p>“It is the best tour in the world like everything you would hope,” he continued. “I really think we have more fun backstage than we do on stage, and we have a lot of fun on stage.”</p><p>McGraw wasn’t the only tourmate whose birthday occurred <a href=#>during the Happiness Begins tour</a>. In August, <a href=#><strong>Joe Jonas</strong></a> celebrated the big 3-0 <a href=#>with a cake brought out by his wife</a>, <a href=#><strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a>, during their Washington, D.C., concert.</p><p>The DNCE frontman kissed Turner, 23, for her sweet gesture. “Couldn’t have asked for a better night, thank you all so much,” Joe wrote on Instagram at the time. “Nothing better than doing what I love with my loves on my birthday ❤️ #HappinessBeginsTour.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Bebe Rexha</strong></a>, the Jonas Brothers’ other tour opener, also celebrated her 30th birthday on the road.

The band — also including <a href=#><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kevin Jonas</strong></a> —&nbsp;had originally <a href=#>parted ways after releasing their fourth studio album</a>, Lines, Vines and Trying Times, in 2009. However, they reunited in March for “Sucker” — <a href=#>the trio’s first single in six years</a>.</p><p>The New Jersey natives followed the debut of singles “Sucker” and “Cool” by dropping their fifth record, Happiness Begins, in June. Their Happiness Begins tour commenced in Miami in August.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp56WwG6u0airoZ2iqHqpu82oqWasn6q%2Frq3TnmSjp6KZrq95zJyeq5mnqHqjtdGtn52ZqWKutXnCqKWcnaKpfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-lockwood-co-scary-the-netflix-thriller-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Is Lockwood &amp;amp; Co scary?
