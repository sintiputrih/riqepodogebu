In it she was highly critical of Corgan and their past.</p><p>When the band opened their Shiny and Oh So Bright tour in Glendale, Arizona, on July 17, 2018, the show featured a music video for the song "Try Try Try". The video featured a model that bore a striking resemblance to D'arcy struggling with drug addiction.</p><p>In August 2016, Corgan posted a video to Facebook stating that he and Wretzky had recently reestablished communication saying "I've been in communication with D'arcy for the first time in 16 or 17 years, it's awesome to have my friend back." Corgan emphasized that this did not necessarily mean the band was getting back together, instead insisting "my primary interest in the old band was us having good relationships again."</p><p>In May 2016 in an interview with Loudwire, Filter lead singer <a href=#>Richard Patrick</a> spoke of a romantic relationship he had with Wretzky saying she was the subject of a song he wrote called "Miss Blue", also on Title of Record.</p><p>In 2013, Wretzky's relationship with Corgan remained tense, with both parties saying that they were not speaking. In September 2014, she tried to re-establish contact with him, but Corgan had changed his phone number.</p><p>Wretzky was jailed on February 1, 2011, for missing four court dates related to a ticket she received for failing to control her wild horses, allowing them to free roam the streets at night causing interference to local traffic, farmers, as well as trespassing on public property and stealing vegetables from the local farmer's market storage. She spent six days in jail. The following day after getting released from jail she was arrested again on February 7, 2011, on a misdemeanor drunken-driving road rage charge in South Haven, Michigan. She was sent back to jail.</p><p>After many years out of the spotlight, Wretzky resurfaced in July 2009 by calling in unexpectedly on Chicago's Q101 FM with Ryan Manno. During the interview, she stated that she was not healthy enough to be a musician, and repeatedly professed her admiration for Monkees frontman <a href=#>Davy Jones</a> who was known to be an early romantic crush of Wretzky's. She also discussed her appreciation for the band Silversun Pickups who have a sound influenced by the early Gish era of the Smashing Pumpkins. She also mentioned that she then lived on a farm in Michigan, that she had briefly lived in Austin, Texas, sometime during the previous decade, and that her former fiancé Wendell Green had died.</p><p>Wretzky did not participate in the Smashing Pumpkins' reunion. In 2008, she and her former boyfriend and bandmate <a href=#>James Iha</a> filed a lawsuit against Virgin Records for selling ringtones of Smashing Pumpkins songs without their consent.</p><p>In 1999, she worked with cellist <a href=#>Eric Remschneider</a>, who she had worked with when he had recorded with the Smashing Pumpkins. That year she also contributed backing vocals on the Filter songs “Cancer" and “Take a Picture” from Title of Record.</p><p>Wretzky contributed vocals to the track "One and Two" on James Iha's 1998 solo album, Let It Come Down.</p><p>Wretzky's time in the band was marked by alternating periods of happiness and discomfort. Corgan considered her the "moral authority" and "moral conscience" of the band. In the aftermath of the success of 1995's Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Corgan said she began an "apparent slow descent into insanity and/or drugs (take your pick)." After the short, nine-date "The Arising!" tour in April 1999 which saw all four original members performing together for the first time since 1996, Wretzky decided to leave the band with intentions of pursuing an acting career. The band were recording Machina/The Machines of God and Machina II/The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music at the time and consequently she performed very few bass parts on the album. Most of the bass parts were handled by Corgan himself. Shortly after leaving the group, she was arrested for possession of crack cocaine. Corgan later said she was "fired for being a mean-spirited drug addict who refused to get help." She was replaced on 2000's Machina tour by former Hole bassist <a href=#>Melissa Auf der Maur</a>.</p><p>Wretzky is the credited bassist on the Smashing Pumpkins' first five studio albums: Gish, Siamese Dream, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Adore, and Machina/The Machines of God. It was confirmed by both her and Corgan, however, that Corgan played the bass tracks for Siamese Dream because he could complete them in far fewer takes. Wretzky often contributed backing vocals in concert, and on studio albums. She contributes vocally in some Smashing Pumpkins songs including "Daydream" from Gish, many songs on Siamese Dream, "1979", "Cupid De Locke", "Farewell and Goodnight", "Beautiful"; "Where Boys Fear to Tread" from Mellon Collie, and "Dreaming" and "The Bells" from The Aeroplane Flies High. Wretzky also co-wrote one Smashing Pumpkins song, "Daughter".</p><p>D'arcy Elizabeth Wretzky-Brown (born May 1, 1968) is an American musician. She is the original bass player of the alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins and is credited on their first five studio albums. She left the band in 1999.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfmXqivsKyZLCqlanHrMU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-narrates-1883.html><span>←</span><span>Who Narrates '1883'?
