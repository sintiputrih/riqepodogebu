When the Georgia native, 50, tells the philanthropist, 49, that she’s a “soulless person,” Diana replies: “You need a new villain? Here I am.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We’re entering our <a href=#>#RHOBH</a> era!!

The New York native, 54, was married to <a href=#><strong>Will Smith</strong></a> from 1992 to 1995, and the duo share son Trey, 29.</p><p>In the trailer, the entrepreneur gets a rude awakening when she arrives to a “casual” party only to find that her fellow cast members are dressed far more formally than she is. “I thought it was yoga clothes,” she laments. “Never ever listen to ‘casual,'” Garcelle advises her.</p><p>Sheree <a href=#>spent time with her ex-husband</a>, 53, after he slapped <a href=#><strong>Chris Rock</strong></a> at the Oscars, but as filming for RHOBH was already underway, it’s not clear whether she will discuss the altercation on the show. “Congratulations @willsmith – you are more than deserving! #family1st #oscars #bestactor ❤️,” she wrote via Instagram last month after the Men in Black star took home the best actor trophy.</p><p>The Whoop Ash founder previously <a href=#>made a cameo during season 10</a> of RHOBH when she and Garcelle discussed their relationships with their ex-husbands. During their conversation, Sheree said she could never “hate” the Philadelphia native because he is the father of her son.</p><p>“Will and I, when we got divorced, we have never had a relationship that doesn’t have Trey at the center of it,” she explained.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 12</a> premieres on Bravo on Wednesday, May 11, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the biggest moments from the trailer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BntbCux2aqnpmjpLtufZFmq6uZmaGys3nTnpisnaNiu6bDjKGmrquVrLansYydqZqlkWLEosDCoWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wendy-williams-lifetime-documentary-trailer-release-date-html.html><span>←</span><span>Wendy Williams Returning to Screens for Unfiltered Doc</span></a>
