The news broke shortly after Britney’s divorce from Sam Asghari was finalized; some reports claim Britney cheated on Sam with Paul when he was under her employment, though it hasn’t been confirmed.</p><p>Britney has since slammed paramedics for invading her privacy, claiming she merely injured her ankle in an accidental fall, denying allegations of a fight.
