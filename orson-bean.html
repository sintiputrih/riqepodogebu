In The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Sir Ian Holm plays Bilbo, but has also played Frodo in the BBC radio version. So Bean and Holm have both played both parts.</p><p>He also appeared on Norman Lear's cult favorite Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman (1976) and its sequel, Forever Fernwood (1977), as "Reverend Brim", and as store owner "Loren Bray" on Dr.</p><p>Founder and first director of the experimental Fifteenth Street School in New York, New York, which only existed for a few years, closing in 1975.

But it was as a television personality that he made his biggest inroads into the popular consciousness, as well as the popular culture.</p><p>He appeared in numerous quiz and talk shows, becoming a familiar face in homes as a regular panelist on To Tell the Truth (1956).</p><p>He made his Broadway debut on April 30, 1954 in Stalag 17 (1953) producer Richard Condon's only Broadway production as a playwright, "Men of Distinction", along with <a href=#>Robert Preston</a> and <a href=#>Martin Ritt</a>.

Too young to see military service during World War II, the future Orson Bean did a hitch in the U. S.</p><p>Army (1946-47) in occupied Japan. After the war, he launched himself onto the nightclub circuit with his new moniker, the "Orson" borrowed from reigning enfant terrible Orson Welles.
