One Instagram user wrote, “You are so beautiful! Everyone wishes they looked this good eating a burger. 🖤” Another said, “Pass the fries sissy!!! I’ll bring the face masks 😍.”</p><p>In a YouTube video posted last October, the beauty expert shared a life update, touching on her struggle with anxiety and depression — as well as the immense hurt she feels when people constantly call out her weight gain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jaclyn-Hill-Claps-Back-Hamburger-Instagram.jpg><p>During the 26-minute video, the Illinois native told her 6 million subscribers “I’m going to grow. I’m going to gain weight. I know I keep bringing up the whole weight thing and the reason I do that is not because of my insecurities, but because of what I see on the Internet.</p><p></p><p>“Why is it all of a sudden OK to call people fat?” asked Hill. “You think I look bad? Imagine how I feel when everyone is saying these things to me. I’ve learned so much from the bad behavior of others.”</p><p>Hill isn’t the only social media star to share a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">body-positive message</a> on social media recently.
