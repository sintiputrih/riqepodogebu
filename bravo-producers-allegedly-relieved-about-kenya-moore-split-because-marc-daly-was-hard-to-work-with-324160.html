What may be a sad song for Kenya is allegedly a wish come true for Bravo Producers.</p><p>Marc has made it clear from the very beginning that he wasn’t a fan of the show. He refused to appear on it for quite some time and was the reason Kenya was given the boot for keeping the most exciting moments of her life a complete secret.</p><p>So it was not a surprise for producers hat when Moore came back hat Marc could be a problem. Between allegedly not wanting to film to trying to restrict how much his soon-to-be ex-wife shares — Daly has been a nuisance to the showrunners.</p><p>The Jasmine Brand exclusively reported that ‘production is relieved Marc is no longer in the picture as he was reportedly difficult to work with and had lots of restrictions concerning his participation in the show.’</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B2btWH1nPOz/</a></p><p>This isn’t a far-fetched theory because during the season ten reunion of Real Housewives of Atlanta, Andy Cohen said that Marc told a producer: ‘[It’s my understanding that] he doesn’t like it, that he thinks this show is a bad representation of black women, and he did not want to be a part of it.’</p><p>Kenya denied the claims when confronted.</p><p>The truth of the matter seems to be that the businessman is more concerned about protecting his reputation as a restaurateur than chasing after fame whereas Kenya is TV gold.</p><p>This comes after the mother of one told People Magazine: ‘It is with profound sadness that I regret to inform my fans that I am divorcing my husband Marc Daly. Due to recent and ongoing circumstances, I can no longer continue in the marriage. My sole concern and focus is and will always be my daughter, Brooklyn, my miracle baby. She was made in love and true commitment. I ask for our privacy to be respected moving forward.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The drama is set to play out this upcoming season of RHOA.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSp663u4ypqaicpZiys7%2BMmqOlnZeasa3FjKucpaGVq7KlecCbpq6sXaCyr8XAZqSop6KaerS8y6KrZpqVmK62v8RmpJqqk2KxorjYZq6aq12drrOwjK2mZq%2Bfp7huw8itn2ZrYml%2Bd3yO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./was-pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla-arrested-fraud-charges-and-wife-myriam-alchanati-bourla.html><span>←</span><span>Was Pfizer CEO, Albert Bourla, Arrested By FBI For Fraud? - Wife and Net Worth 2021</span></a>
