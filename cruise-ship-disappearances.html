According to her family, the 47-year-old only agreed to go because the trip was prepaid. She decided she would choose whether or not she wanted to stay in the relationship after the couple returned home.</p><p>But Amani never did. On Feb. 29, 2012, somewhere between the Bahamas and Florida, the Canadian woman disappeared from the ship.</p><p>As her boyfriend tells it, nothing about their cruise trip seemed unusual. He told investigators that he last saw his girlfriend around 1 a.m. outside a duty-free shop. Golshani claims that he went to sleep and became alarmed when he woke up and found that Amani hadn’t returned to their room.</p><p>After searching for about an hour, Golshani alerted members of the crew.</p><p>“The way he explains it… he got back to [the] room, went to bed, she still wasn’t there,” Celebration Cruise Lines president Charles Kinnear told <a href=# rel=noopener>CBC</a>. “When he got up in the morning, still wasn’t there. He walked around the ship for a while before he decided to come and tell us.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-389512 alt="Fariba Amani In A Red Dress" width=800 height=817 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fariba-amani-in-a-red-dress.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-389512 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>YouTube</span><span class=caption-body>Fariba Amani was apparently unsure about her relationship and was thinking of breaking up with Ramiz Golshani.</span></p><p>Amani’s family, however, is insistent that she wouldn’t have fallen overboard on accident. “I don’t think this was accidental,” her sister Saloumeh told ABC. “She didn’t drink, she couldn’t have just stumbled and fallen off board.”</p><p>What’s more, Amani’s family told the media that Amani was thinking about ending her relationship with Golshani. Her sister told ABC that she thought Golshani was cheating on her, and that he could be extremely controlling.</p><p>“She would go on the cruise and see because maybe the relationship would get better afterwards, but if it wouldn’t then she would break up with him,” Saloumeh explained.</p><p>Sadly, there have been few developments in Fariba Amani’s cruise ship disappearance since 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonykvtSiqp5lo522sXnDoqqaqKCarrOtzZycrGdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rudy-ray-moore.html><span>←</span><span>Rudy Ray Moore And The True Story Of 'Dolemite Is My Name'</span></a>
