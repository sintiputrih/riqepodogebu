I’m not sure about Australia.”</span></p><h2><span>Jacob Elordi Discusses Working With Female Co-Stars</span></h2><p><span>In another interview, Elordi talked about filming personal sequences with his two female co-stars, Alexa Demie and Sydney Sweeney.</span><span> In season 2 of Euphoria, viewers were stunned by the unexpected pairing of Elordi’s Nate and Sweeney’s Cassie.</span><span> Elordi told Entertainment Weekly that his approach to working with Sydney and Alexa Demie (who plays Maddy) was highly different.</span><span> Elordi and Sydney had several private sections beyond the first two episodes, which the Kissing Booth actor touched on.</span></p><p><span>“She’s so brilliant at what she does that it was a pleasure to work with her the entire time.” “She brings it every time,” Elordi added.</span></p><p>His moments with Sweeney were heated, but they had fun exploring different relationships.</p><h2><span>Other Members of the ‘Euphoria’ Cast on Nudity</span></h2><p><span>Overall, there is a lot of nudity, and everyone is okay with it.</span><span> Sweeney, his co-star, frequently stripped-down, revealed that she was at ease with the nudity because she never felt compelled to do so. </span><span>It was, in fact, the actress’s first project in which she felt empowered to speak up and express herself.</span></p><p><span>“There were times when Cassie was meant to go shirtless, and I’d tell Sam, ‘I don’t believe that’s really required here. </span><span>He was like, ‘OK, we don’t need it,'” the actress explained.</span></p><p>Sweeney said she once felt so ashamed she wanted to scrub herself raw.</p><p>Eric Dane, who plays Nate’s father, Cal, said the nudity was necessary for the plot.</p><p><span>“Everything serves a purpose.” And I believe it’s useful as long as it serves a purpose in the framework of the story,” Dane told E! News.</span></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihmpufl3qmuM6rm6Jln6N6tbTEZpylpJWjerS0zrBkrZmcoLavs4yamaitpGK1qr%2BMp5iknZRiwKSxzZ6qaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kylie-minogue-dannii-minogue-love-cardigan-qvc.html><span>←</span><span>Dannii Minogue and sister Kylie both love this dreamy knit - and you won't believe the price</span></a>
