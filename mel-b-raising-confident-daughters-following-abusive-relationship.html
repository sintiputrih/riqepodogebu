"They've read my book. They also know that three women a week are killed by their abusive partner.</p><p id=ebrrjUqqEmb data-wc=52>"We talk a lot in our house. It's so important, especially with kids who are in their teens, or coming up to them, as their hormones are all over the place.

"They are quite considerate – and stingy," she jokes.</p><p id=eeZjqpJfHSi data-wc=72>Reflecting on her age, having been in the Spice Girls spotlight since she was a late teen, Melanie says: "You are as old as you feel. Numbers aren't relevant. You can have a bit of a panic when you come into your 40s, because you haven't got things quite as you thought they were going to be. You have some of your hardest challenges. But there's also something really freeing about it.&nbsp;</p><p id=ejxFYsaGRyC data-wc=43>"I don't know if it's because you're putting yourself out there, or just ready for it in life. But there's a lot to be said about women in their 40s because they're more aware and self-assured. It's an age not to mess with."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b192b5b1ebc7-gettyimages-1681035420-1.jpg><p id=eOB4XWIGW6D data-wc=40>It has taken her several years, however, to reach this point in her own life. In 2018, Melanie wrote her memoir , which was republished this week with three new chapters, describing how she started again "from ground zero".</p><p id=eqcqdDQ_vyW data-wc=19>She is, she acknowledges, still a work in progress, and "on a path to self-healing".
