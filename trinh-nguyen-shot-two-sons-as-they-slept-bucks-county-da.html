Ngyuen allegedly “pulled the trigger two times, but the gun did not fire.”&nbsp;Shockingly, the neighbor said that Nguyen had asked him to give her ex-husband a “box of photos.” Melchiondo realized the suspect was pointing a gun at his head when he turned around, the complaint said. Melchiondo also said he worked with Nguyen’s ex-husband.</p><p>Once disarmed, Nguyen <a href=#>allegedly fled the scene in a minivan</a> and towards New Jersey. She was arrested before noon.</p><p>“At approximately 11:30 a.m., law enforcement located her at the United Methodist Church in Washington’s Crossing,” the DA’s office said. “She was taken to St. Mary’s Medical Center due to the indication that she was under the influence.”</p><p>Cops found the two boys inside the residence with “gunshot wounds to their heads,” the complaint said.</p><p>Nguyen was denied bail and faces three counts of attempted homicide, and one count of possession of an instrument of crime.</p><p>The DA reportedly said authorities have “<a href=#>strong leads</a>” on a motive. The Bucks County Courier Times <a href=#>reported</a> that Nguyen was facing eviction.</p><p>The news has <a href=#>devastated the local community</a> and the Council Rock School District.</p><p>Acting Superintendent of Schools <strong>Susan Elliott</strong> said in a <a href=#>message on Facebook to the community</a> that she was “deeply saddened to send this communication to you in light of the well-publicized tragedy involving two Council Rock students today.”</p><p>“A tragic event is always difficult to process for all of us, especially our children. We tend to process such information in different ways and at different paces. It is not uncommon to experience difficulty eating, sleeping, or concentrating. For more information about how to cope with these types of tragic events, please visit the grief resources on our website,” Elliott said. “Please know that we will continue to monitor our students and staff and provide them the support they need while they are at school.”</p><p>“When these types of tragic events occur in our community, it’s important that we pull together to support each other. I humbly ask you to keep the family, our students, our staff, and our community in your thoughts and prayers.” she added.</p><p>Read the complaint below:</p><p>[Image via Bucks County DA]</p><p>Have a tip we should know? <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=3145584142715d5046505f555243585c541f525e5c>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6m%2FqrrHZqWgramau26%2Fx6irZqynpHq0u82sZJqrXam1psWMrKOeqKRir7avyqxknKelo8G6ecOaZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./night-court-cast-net-worth-ranked.html><span>←</span><span>The Cast Of Night Court, Ranked By Net Worth</span></a>
