Rice does not contain gluten in any form. Due to the fact that Minute Rice is an Instant rice, which is a pre-cooked and dried rice, it does not include gluten (it is just rice…). Gluten is a protein that can only be found in the grains of wheat, barley, rye, and triticale (and their hybrids). Because rice does not contain gluten, it is not possible to eliminate it."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It also loses part of its taste as a result of the processing procedure.</p><h3></h3><h3>There were 39 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is there gluten in the spaghetti you’re eating?</h3><p>Gluten is a word used to refer to a protein that may be found in grains such as wheat, barley, rye, and triticale.
