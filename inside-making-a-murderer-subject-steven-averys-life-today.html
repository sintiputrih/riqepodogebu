And in August 2017, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Post Crescent</a> provided a glimpse into life at the prison. The cells are small, with a bed, foot locker, sink, and toilet. The days typically began around 6 a.m., with lights off at 10 p.m. Days are spent working, attending classes, doing programs, or simply being in the cells. While there were computers available, inmates were not allowed access to the internet. Email was available, at a per-email cost. Inmates could watch local television channels, but no cable.</p><p>Since taking over Avery's case, Zellner has worked to prove her client was wrongly convicted. As she told <a href=#>The Guardian</a>&nbsp;in 2018, "I am positive of it. I know that he's innocent." As she has pursued new evidence and submitted documents to get Avery's conviction overturned, she's also shared updates on his life.&nbsp;</p><p>In an August 2019 <a href=#>Instagram</a> post that showed Avery visiting with his mother, Zellner wrote, "The power of love outshines the politics of hate every time." A couple of months later, Zellner shared a new <a href=#>Instagram</a> post with another photo of Avery. "If you think Steven Avery has given up on being freed think again!!!" She added, "He is surrounded by people who love & support him. We work on this case everyday & we will prevail...you can count on it!!!!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW9laX10e8inqqKclWK6orfIp55mmV2iwrOwxKucq2Wjqq%2BrscKtZKyslauyr3nAr5yrsaNiuaqyxGarqJyRrnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dylan-gelula-bio-wiki-age-height-husband-family-unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Dylan Gelula Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Family, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Net Worth</span></a>
