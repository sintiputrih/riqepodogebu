The amazing celebrity Nick Cannon was born in 1980 in San Diego, California. As a dancer on Soul Train and a stand-up comedian in Los Angeles, he made his debut in the entertainment business. Cannon swiftly found a home on the Nickelodeon cable channel, like many of his other teen stars. He joined the cast of the teen sketch comedy programme All That for the 1998 season. He worked across the board for the channel at this period, writing and hosting series for Cousin Skeeter and Kenan & Kel.&nbsp; Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, a Nickelodeon animated film, featured a cover of Cannon’s song “Parents Just Don’t Understand” (originally performed by DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince). He had a few supporting roles in the movies Whatever It Takes and Men in Black II before he was poised to make his big break in music, cinema, and television. As a “rapper,” Cannon launched his debut self-titled album in 2003 with the popular tune “Gigolo,” a duet with singer R. Kelly. His first leading part came in the musical drama Drumline from 2002.</p><p>As host of the competitive reality series America’s Got Talent in 2008, Cannon also wed pop artist Mariah Carey on April 30 at her exclusive mansion on Windermere Island in The Bahamas. Fox News stated that Cannon and Mariah Carey had a prenuptial contract. The couple’s achievement of becoming parents to a boy and a girl coincided with their third wedding anniversary. The estimated nett worth of Mariah Carey is $500 million. The entrepreneur and MTV Networks figure serves as TeenNick’s chairman as well as the network’s development and creative consultant. In 2010, Nick Cannon founded N’Credible Entertainment, also known as N’Credible Records.</p><p>Cannon confirmed the rumours that he and Carey had split up for good in August 2014.</p><h2 class=net-profile_section_title>STATISTICS</h2><ul class=net-profile_stats_list readability=1><li><h3>Source of Wealth:</h3><p>Music, Television, Film</p></li><li><h3>Age:</h3><p>40</p></li><li><h3>Birth Place:</h3><p>Nicholas Scott Cannon</p></li><li><h3>Height:</h3><p>6′ 0″ (1.83 m)</p></li><li><h3>Weight:</h3><p>180 lbs (81 kg)</p></li><li><h3>Marital Status:</h3><p>Separated (Mariah Carey)</p></li><li><h3>Full Name:</h3><p>Nicholas Scott Cannon</p></li><li><h3>Nationality:</h3><p>American</p></li><li><h3>Date of Birth:</h3><p>October 8, 1980</p></li><li><h3>Ethnicity:</h3><p>African American</p></li><li readability=2><h3>Occupation:</h3><p>Actor, Rapper, Comedian, TV/Record producer</p></li><li><h3>Education:</h3><p>Monte Vista High School</p></li><li readability=11><h3>Children:</h3><p>2 ( Monroe, Moroccan Scott)</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Sale of Asset 2015</strong>In 2015, Cannon and wife, Carey, was closed to selling their Bel Air home for $9 million.</p><p>$9,000,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Performance Fee 2013</strong>Minimum Fee Per Performance in the US</p><p>$75,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Asset 2013</strong>The value of Cannon’s Ferrari F430</p><p>$188,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Salary 2013</strong>Per Episode of America’s Got Talent</p><p>$70,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Asset 2013</strong>The value of Cannon’s Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon</p><p>$110,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Others 2013</strong>Earnings from the Sale of Ncredible Headphones</p><p>$30,000,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Performance Fee 2013</strong>Minimum Fee per International performance</p><p>$225,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Asset 2013</strong>The value of Cannon’s Rolls Royce DropHead Coupe</p><p>$452,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Earnings 2012</strong>Minimum earnings in 2012</p><p>$10,000,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Misc. 2012</strong>The couple’s earnings in 2012</p><p>$530,000,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Asset 2009</strong>In April 2009, Mariah Carey and Nick cannon purchased their Bel Air mansion for $6.975 million.</p><p>$6,975</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGilopubYrCius2opWamlal6uLvRrZ9moJ%2BserO1wqFkoqtdo7akt44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matt-stell.html><span>←</span><span>Matt Stell - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Facts, Career</span></a>
