Soon, the hate comments started flooding it.

Since posting that video, I have battled depressive episodes and had my life, safety, and well-being violated,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, she finds it “imperative to reclaim my name and let people know that there is a real person behind my content.” She claimed that the only reason she was&nbsp; “punished online” was because of her delivery.</span></p><p><span>“It wasn’t what I said, and it was how I said it. But I was just being my true self, and if you follow me, you know that’s how I speak. My approach can be abrasive, but I’m just a direct speaker. However, nothing I said in that video was wrong,” she once again stood her ground.</span></p><h3><b>TikTok Therapist Unusually Bree Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>TikTok Therapist Unusually Bree garnered a net worth of under $250 thousand by 2023.</span></p><p><span>This popular therapist started her career in 2016, right after graduating from </span><i><span>Baldwin Wallace University </span></i><span>with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology degree (named to the&nbsp; Dean’s List).</span></p><p><span>Showcasing her degree on IG, Bree wrote, “The single most expensive piece of paper that I’ve ever purchased.” She then went on to recall her “stories, memories, and experiences” that were all crammed into this one sheet of paper. “From traveling the world to surviving all-nighters, it was all so worth it.
