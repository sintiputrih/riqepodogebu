After being laid off from a 7-year career at Wall Street and being forced to move into a one-bedroom apartment with her mom, she approached Stormy to get her life back in order. And now that she does, she is also a part of the “Circle of Bosses” alongside Stormy on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Million Dollar Hustle</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This Bianca Shadai Bio explores her life.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Bianca Shadai On Million Dollar Hustle</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Lifetime’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Million Dollar Hustle</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> premiered on Mar 17, 2022, and it saw Stormy Wellington aiding the female leaders — personally and financially — succeed in their hustles. Bianca Shadai was one of those “female leaders” who faced off the other participants, proving their worth that they deserved a place in Stormy’s inner elite circle.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Bianca in this inaugural were her co-stars — Dianna Williams, Nathalie Nicole Smith, Ana Cantera, Bawselady, Tammy Price, and Stormy’s very own daughter Maniya Essence.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Bianca first met Stormy as a client who wasn’t feeling the best about her self-image. At the time, Bianca purchased NutraBurst®liquid multivitamin, NRG dietary supplement, and Iaso® Instant detox Tea, and the next thing she knew, she was teaming up socially to do a 30-day weight loss challenge with a cash reward.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And that was the moment when the products went from her “head to heart.” Meeting the girls she never met before, being responsible for changing their lives, she felt empowered.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Eventually, Bianca then met Nathalie Nicole Smith, her sponsor, at one of Stormy’s events. The two immediately connected, admittedly due to similar struggles and since then Bianca’s business has only bloomed.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Having been through so much, it was only natural for Stormy to acknowledge her will to succeed. Thus, she was invited to the “Circle of Bosses” and given a shot a life to be a part of the top entrepreneurs’ circle in the US.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For those wondering how much of the show is real? Well, as for as well know the show’s totally legit. If you feel like Stormy and her fellow Circle of Bosses are a little much at times, it’s only because they share the same confidence which got them where they are today.</span></p><h3><b>Bianca Shadai Net Worth</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Bianca Shadai’s reported net worth was around $1 million as of 2022.
