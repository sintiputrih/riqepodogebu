It comes three months after the her Grammy-winning husband <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong></a>, 39, got called out for cozying up to his Palmer co-star <strong>Alisha Wainwright</strong>, 30, at a bar in New Orleans. The actress walked out of a Health Mart Pharmacy, flashed a brief smile, and then hopped into her Tesla and drove off. She looked super stylish in a dark floral print jumpsuit that gave us major Spring vibes, and paired it with a white knit cardigan which she left unbuttoned, and slippers. Jessica also carried a black shoulder bag and shielded her eyes with dark sunglasses. This is the first time the Hollywood A-lister has been spotted without her ring on. She and Justin have been married since 2012, and have reportedly been working on their relationship following the scandal.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>It was back in November that photos emerged of JT and his co-star Alisha Wainwright&nbsp;appearing to be more than friends. The actors were pictured getting cozy during a cast outing at a bar in New Orleans on November 23, with one photo capturing the two holding hands under a table while partying on the bar’s balcony. Justin later released a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>public apology</a>&nbsp;to his wife and their&nbsp;4-year-old son,&nbsp;<strong>Silas.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“A few weeks ago I displayed a strong lapse in judgement — but let me be clear — nothing happened between me and my costar,” he wrote in a note on on Instagram, December 4, admitting, “I drank way too much that night and I regret my behavior. I should have known better. This is not the example I want to set for my son,” Justin continued. “I apologize to my amazing wife and family for putting them through such an embarrassing situation, and I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be. This was not that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jessica-biel-no-wedding-ring-husband-justin-timberlake-scandal-backgrid-post-.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Justin recently supported his wife at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>premiere</a> for season three of her show The Sinner.
