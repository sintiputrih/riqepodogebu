Like its name suggests, the Pharaoh is modeled after the mystical Mummy. Because of this, you will first need to find its Sarcophagus and then find and place eight skulls in order to awaken the Pharaoh. So here’s the location of the <strong>Pharaoh in Warzone DMZ, as well as how to secure skulls and place them in the Sarcophagus</strong> to summon it.</p><a href=# rel=attachment><img fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2023/10/Warzone-DMZ-Pharaoh-Secure-Skulls-and-Place-Them-in-Sarcophagus-640x360.webp data-no-lazy=1 alt="Warzone DMZ Pharaoh, Secure Skulls and Place Them in Sarcophagus" width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>Warzone DMZ Pharaoh, Secure Skulls and Place Them in Sarcophagus<h2>Where to Find Pharaoh Warzone DMZ</h2><p>You can find the Pharaoh in the Al Mazrah Oasis, which is northwest from Rohan Oil. We have marked the exact location of the Pharaoh’s tomb in our screenshot, which you can see below. Of course, be careful once you get inside, as enemy Operators are most likely close by and they can easily ruin this boss fight for you.</p>';document.getElementById("serge_5f895c6208f81a315320ec57").style.display = "block"; } <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2023/10/Warzone-DMZ-Pharaoh-Secure-Skulls-and-Place-Them-in-Sarcophagus-640x360.webp><h2>Secure the Skulls and Place Them in the Sarcophagus to Awake Pharaoh in Warzone DMZ</h2><p>Once you are inside the tomb, your job is to eliminate the enemies there. Specifically, the red-headed enemies. This is because they drop red Cursed Skulls once they are downed. You specifically need to collect eight of these Skulls. This can take a while, but it is the only way you will be able to face (and then hopefully defeat) the Pharaoh. Once you have gathered enough of them, place the skulls inside the Pharaoh’s Sarcophagus. Doing this will cause the Pharaoh to awaken and to then attack you. Needless to say, but you should be ready for a tough fight here. Concentrate all your firepower towards the Pharaoh boss and run away if you see it coming directly towards you – as he can one-shot kill you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvSrqWop5JjsLC5jpymnWWnlr%2B7u82eZGtnlKLHbrzHmqmap5hiwKav1KucZqubqrmtv4ypo5qblWLAor7CqKehmZeqwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taissa-farmiga-net-worth-187227.html><span>←</span><span>Taissa Farmiga Net Worth</span></a>
