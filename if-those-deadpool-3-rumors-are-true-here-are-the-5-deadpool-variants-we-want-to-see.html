It is currently unknown how that will happen, but at least this means that the events of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Logan</a> remain untouched. After all, Marvel has multiple ways of tapping into the multiverse and having various versions of the same superhero collide.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>If these rumors are true, then this is the perfect opportunity to showcase the different types of Deadpools in existence. Wade Wilson isn’t the only foul-mouthed merc in the Marvel Universe, you know. Other eccentric variations have appeared throughout the comics, either carrying or adapting the Deadpool name. So if this movie were to feature a vast variety of Deadpool variants, here are the top five that should be included.</p><h2 id=h-5-deadpool-2099 data-injectable=false>5. Deadpool 2099</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/4-1.jpg><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=790 data-injectable=true>If <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</a> introduces us to Miguel O’Hara (aka Spider-Man 2099), then Deadpool 3 could be the perfect opportunity to introduce Deadpool 2099. Unlike the other Deadpool variants, this one looks more robotic and futuristic. This young Deadpool is the daughter of Wade Wilson. She goes through a redemption arc and became a rival to her father. Perhaps this story could continue in the upcoming MCU film, with her thinking that she’s up against her dad.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Galactipool</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3-1.jpg><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>Remember that scene in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eternals</a>? The one when a giant hand emerged from the ocean since our heroes stopped the birth of a celestial? How come nobody in the MCU has addressed that yet? Perhaps Deadpool 3 will be the moment when that event is finally mentioned outside the 2021 film. Galactipool could be the main threat that unites all the Wolverine and Deadpool variants as they join forces to fight this big threat.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. Venompool</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=876 data-injectable=true>Venom has yet to appear in the MCU. Sure, the events of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: No Way Home</a> pave the way for that to happen at some point. But so far, it is currently unknown when the fan-favorite symbiote will appear. So why not throw us a bone and give this Venom variant a chance to shine in the MCU through its Deadpool persona? Sure, it’s not the same, but if fans were upset that <a href=#>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</a> wasn’t R-rated, then perhaps the MCU’s Deadpool, which promises to keep its R-rating, could be the perfect opportunity to show off how violent Venom can be.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Wolverinepool</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-1.jpg><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>If Deadpool 3 were to bring back Wolverine from the dead through other means, then why not combine the two characters? It is currently unknown how all these variants will collide (again, presuming the rumors bear weight). But perhaps for some reason, the way all these variants appear in one place could cause the two to fuse together. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The MCU has a history of changing the origin stories of some characters</a>, so why not do the same for this Deadpool cameo?</p><h2 id=h-1-gwenpool data-injectable=false>1. Gwenpool</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-1.jpg><p data-characters=622 data-current-count=922 data-injectable=false>What makes Gwenpool different from Lady Deadpool is that she is not just some female variant of Wade Wilson. And no, she’s not Gwen Stacy. Funnily enough, her real name is Gwendolyn “Gwen” Poole. Before Gwenpool became the person we know, she came from our universe. Yes, she’s someone from beyond the fourth wall. She’s a Marvel fan who suddenly got sucked into the comics and became her own version of Deadpool. From there, she used her comic book knowledge to fight bad guys. Fingers crossed that her appearance and inevitable meta-humor won’t be as questionable as She-Hulk’s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooJ9lpJ28tLGMnZyanKCkvK15kmaprqWfp8BurdGeZK2qpZp6qbHRnmSaqpViwamxjG5knZ2Rmb2wu8tmrZqqmZa7tb%2BMsJxmr5GjwW7Azmaqnp1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./traci-lynn-johnson-maxim-pics-tiki-barber.html><span>←</span><span>Former NFLer Tiki Barber &amp;amp; Fiancee Traci Lynn Johnson Torment His Estranged Wife With Racy Lingerie</span></a>
