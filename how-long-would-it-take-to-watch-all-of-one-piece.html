Both the manga and the anime are ongoing. As of July 2023, the manga has 106 tankōbon volumes, while the anime has accumulated over 1000 episodes. One Piece was the best-selling manga for 11 consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and the anime has also garnered a substantial following.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>If you’re new to the One Piece fanbase or your curiosity is simply getting the better of you, you might be wondering how long it would take to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">watch all of One Piece</a> in one very, very time-consuming sitting.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How many episodes of One Piece are there?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/jewelry-bonney-one-piece.png><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Ahead of the January 2024 premiere of season 21, there are 1,088 episodes of One Piece. The last season of the show, Wano Country, which lasted from 2019 to 2023 due to several factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, was made up of a whopping 197 episodes. That’s more than most TV shows have in a lifetime!</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>The 21st season of the show, Egghead, will begin on January 7th, 2024. So far, there’s been no official word on how many episodes this season will have, but judging from previous seasons, it will almost certainly be a lot.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How many volumes of One Piece are there?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/One-Piece-Manga.jpg><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>As of January 2024, there are 107 volumes of the One Piece manga that the anime is based on. According to experts at<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Anime Filler Guide</a>, the series is operating at an almost identical pace as the manga, estimating that series 20 ends at approximately Volume 105.</p><h2 id=h-how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-one-piece data-injectable=false>How long would it take to watch all of One Piece?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/one-piece.png><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>On average, each episode lasts around 22-24 minutes, so if we use 23 minutes as the norm, multiply that by the current number of episodes — that being 1071 as of this writing — that brings us to a total of 24,633 minutes. That equates to around 410.5 hours, or 17.10 days. And that’s only for uninterrupted viewing, which means no pausing to go to the bathroom, and get ready for some pretty excessive sleep deprivation, which no healthcare professional would recommend trying out.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>That’s not to say that you can’t take your time to watch One Piece like a normal person, but if you’re the daredevil type, who are we to tell you no? We doubt you’ll get very far without a good night’s sleep, though. Luffy and the gang will still be there when you wake up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6hprBlnKS7qHnWqKylnF2ewW7AwKScZqyfYsSiwMKhZJqknGK8p3nOp5xmqJmasKZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-yaman-4.html><span>←</span><span>Can Yaman Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
