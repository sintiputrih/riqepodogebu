This means that console players who want to enjoy the game will need to have access to a PC.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud 9 is set to sign 2 new pros to complete their Valorant roster</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_Valorant_not_on_consoles></span><strong>Why is Valorant not on consoles?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ezgif.com-gif-maker-1024x576.jpg><p>There are several possible reasons why Valorant is not available on Xbox or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a> yet. Primarily, the game was designed with the PC platform in mind. The developers possibly wanted to ensure that the game is optimized for the best performance on this platform. This means that Riot Games has tailored the game to take advantage of the power and capabilities of PC hardware. This includes advanced graphics and high frame rates. With games such as League of Legends, Riot Games has a strong history of releasing games primarily focused on PC gameplay.</p><p>Secondly, the competitive nature of Valorant’s gameplay requires precise aiming and quick reflexes. This precise nature of play can be difficult to achieve on consoles. The mouse and keyboard setup is standard for PC gaming. These controls provide a level of precision and control that is difficult to match with a controller on consoles. Riot Games may feel that bringing the game to consoles could compromise Valorant’s competitive gameplay, which the game is known for.</p><p>Riot Games may simply focus on developing and improving the PC version of Valorant. The developer is likely prioritizing the development of new content and features for the existing PC player base.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-valorant-ever-going-to-come-to-consoles><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Valorant_ever_going_to_come_to_consoles></span><strong>Is Valorant ever going to come to consoles?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-10-1024x576.jpg><p>It is currently unclear whether Riot Games will make Valorant available on consoles in the near future. In an interview with GameSpot in 2020, Anna Donlon, the Executive Producer for Valorant, mentioned that a console port was in the works, but it wasn’t a priority at the time. There have been other instances where developers have talked about exploring a console port for the tactical shooter, indicating the company’s interest in bringing the game to consoles. However, the timeline for this remains unknown.</p><p>The Xbox Game Pass recently added Valorant, but it remains unclear whether this addition suggests an imminent console release. In August 2022, data miners discovered files related to Xbox and PlayStation within the game file, indicating the possibility of a console port. However, the lack of any official communication from Riot Games has made it difficult for the community to speculate.</p><p>In case you missed it:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xKynqKqkqHqqv4yvmKWnopa7tXnAr5iipJGXuaZ5zqdksZqfrXqwvoypo5qxo6mutbXOp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./in-memoriam-remembering-tmf-vice-president-kelly-roseberry-and-the-circumstances-of-her-passing.html><span>←</span><span>In Memoriam: Remembering TMF Vice President Kelly Roseberry and the Circumstances of Her Passing. -</span></a>
