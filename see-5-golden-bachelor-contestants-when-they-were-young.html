<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>See 5 Golden Bachelor Contestants When They Were Young</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Golden Bachelor <a href=#>Gerry Turner</a> has his work cut out for him. The 72-year-old widower from Indiana is searching for a second chance at love with one of 22 women, and let me be the first to say—they’re all gorgeous.</p><p>Of course, Gerry is old enough and wise enough to know that looks aren’t everything. These women, all of whom are over 60, have lived lives filled with friendship, careers, children, lovers, and even loss, and they have the stories and smile lines to prove it.</p><p>But a few of these stories come with photographic evidence, which the women have shared on Instagram over the years. There was Leslie’s time as an aerobics champion, Renee’s NFL cheerleading days, and Sandra’s spin as a contestant on Wheel of Fortune (she <a href=#>won the game</a> and the bonus round, for the record!). If you loved the hair, the clothes, and the glam of the ’70s and ’80s, look no further.</p><p>Ahead of the premiere of The Golden Bachelor on September 28, we’re taking a look back at five of the women who couldn’t resist a #TBT.</p><h2><strong>Leslie</strong></h2><p><a href=#>According to her bio</a>, Leslie is a former professional figure skater—but skating isn’t her only talent. <a data-offer-url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CxtbTvbpPm0 class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CxtbTvbpPm0"}' href=# rel=noopener>In an Instagram post</a> shared on September 27, Leslie says she was also a national aerobics champion at just 25 years old. She added the hashtag #80sbaby, which feels appropriate because I can’t think of anything more ’80s than a national aerobics competition.</p><figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset"></span></figure><p>The only thing missing from this ’80s-tastic photo—in which Leslie rocks a curly pixie that adds a good three inches to her height—is a Jane Fonda cameo.</p><h2><strong>Sandra</strong></h2><p>Sandra, 75, may have a leg up on the competition, and it has nothing to do with her ability to woo Gerry. The former executive assistant has experience in front of the camera, having won an episode of Wheel of Fortune back in November 1988. (Better luck next time, <a href=#>Karol and Tim</a>!)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauql6YvK570q2mq7FfqLKmeZRmnqiklJq7bq7AnJ%2BepJ%2BneqS7za2crKyRo8G0edahnKdlpJ2yunnWnqmeZamkwq%2Bz</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mathilde-ollivier-age-height-net-worth-wiki-instagram-bio.html><span>←</span><span>Mathilde Ollivier Age Height, Net Worth Wiki &amp;amp; Instagram Bio</span></a>
