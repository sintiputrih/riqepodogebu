His marriage to Quani is a firm favorite interaction seen on the show, while they look after their children together.</p><p><a href=#>Fans think</a> that Puma often uses his co-star <a href=#>Ceaser Emanuel</a> as an ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù to not live out his dreams. The question ultimately leads to how much he earns and whether it‚Äôs worth it to continue inking up tattoos at the shop.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/04/GettyImages-186079655-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-puma-s-net-worth>Puma‚Äôs net worth</h2><p>Puma has accumulated a net worth of $150K for owning Art 2 Ink tattoo studio and starring on VH1‚Äôs show Black Ink Crew. He continues to focus on bringing wealth in, having been part of a <a href=#>$12K NFT auction sale</a> recently!</p><p>The reality star formerly worked for Ceasar at Black Ink before he was fired, as seen on the series. He later returned to Black Ink after making amends with his long-time friend in season eight, as per <a href=#>The YBF</a>.</p><p>Puma‚Äôs wife Quani had her husband‚Äôs back, and told Ceasar: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs promoting your business while he‚Äôs not promoting his own business. It seems like it benefiting you more than it‚Äôs benefitting him.‚Äù</p><p>However, Ceasar dropped the news that he gave Puma ‚Äúhalf‚Äù of Black Ink due to their plans to ‚Äútake over Harlem.‚Äù As the man who launched the shop initially, he is currently <a href=#>worth a whopping $2.5million</a>, as of February 2022.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Puma please stop using ceaser as an excuse, to not live out your dreams w/ your family.

It wasn‚Äôt long before making art on walls quickly developed into working within a tattoo parlour.</p><p>Although Puma‚Äôs salary for appearing on the show has not been disclosed,&nbsp;<a href=#>Distractify</a>&nbsp;reports that&nbsp;<a href=#>former cast member Sky</a>&nbsp;earned $7,000 per episode, meaning she took home $91,000 for a full season.</p><p>Considering Puma has a prominent role at the tattoo shop, he gets a hefty salary for each season. Now on its ninth ever season, he likely earns more towards the $10K mark for filming each episode.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Congratulations Puma.

If this doesn‚Äôt highlights their fortune enough, Puma recently posed next to a Cadillac!</p><p>From regular award nights to chilling at beach clubs, the <a href=#>VH1</a> reality star always seems to be having fun, and that‚Äôs likely down to his positive energy and family surrounding him, including wife Quani.</p><p>The father-of-two ensures that his family are always kept safe. His long-time friend Ceasar recently told <a href=#>Nicki Swift</a> that he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to come out the house, which I could understand because he has a family and kids he got to protect.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by PUMA¬ÆÔ∏è (@puma213)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH BLACK INK CREW ON VH1 EVERY MONDAY AT 8/7C</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdnkqGupLeMoqWkZZOnsri%2FjKmsppldoq6ssdJmmGaqn5a%2FqrrGZp2oqqSqu6Z5yKeqopyVYsOpfYytmK2sn6R6sa3Rpaauqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toby-froud-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Toby Froud Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
