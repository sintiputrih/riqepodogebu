Similarly, taps are clearly not a problem: when did you last hear of someone getting ill from pouring a glass of water from a tap?</p><p>“Water bottles are likely to be contaminated with the bacteria that are already in people’s mouths.”</p><p>Squeeze-top bottles were ultimately the cleanest of the three styles tested, with a tenth of the amount of bacteria as one with a screw-top or straw-fitted lid.</p><p>Suffice to say, cleaning your bottle needs to be a part of your daily routine.</p><p>Experts recommend washing it at least once a day with hot soapy water, and sanitizing it at least once a week – though increase the habit if you’ve been unwell, drink from it while eating, or are filling it with something other than water.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmamtfp7K2v8Cbo55lp5bBpr6Mm6atrJyawG60zqWbZqWfp7JursCcq56qmZZ6tbTAp2Stp5mhsrV50p6YrWWjqcKlxYyfoKeco2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikki-mudarris-and-liangelo-ball-welcome-baby-lavelo-ball.html><span>←</span><span>NIKKI MUDARRIS AND LIANGELO BALL WELCOME BABY LAVELO BALL</span></a>
