She was flashing nipple all night at the crowd and at one time playfully cupped her left boob when the camera panned across the court side seats.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Shortly before she let the world see her pink hair Rihanna tweeted: “<span>We raided Nicki’s [Minaj] wig closet for the summer! Bad gals just wanna have fun!”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>We guess she would just “wanna have fun” and maybe take her mind off the rocky relationship she’s had with Drake in the process.</p><h3>Rihanna Grabs Boob & Sports Pink Locks At NBA Playoff Game</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>On May 14 we managed to get the exclusive details about Drake and Rihanna calling it quits. Apparently, Drake had told RiRi she was becoming “to needy” and that he needed space to focus on his career. Rihanna immediately became offended.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>After that initial blowup, Drake and Rihanna had another fight, according to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Us Weekly</a>. “<span>He is too in love with her, which has always been the problem,” a source told the magazine. “They have been fighting, but that could all change any day now.
