The debate between two superpowered heroes can get pretty heated, with fans on both sides making excellent arguments for their favorite. The latest query surrounds Goku vs. Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel.</p><h2 id=h-who-would-win-in-a-battle data-injectable=false>Who would win in a battle?</h2><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>Captain Marvel made her debut in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> in 2019. Carol Danvers was a human who was exposed to the Space Stone housed inside the Tesseract. After waking with amnesia, her DNA was altered after receiving a blood transfusion from the Kree during the events of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Captain Marvel</a> film.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=628 data-current-count=928 data-injectable=true>Captain Marvel’s abilities include super speed and super strength, among others. She can also produce photon blasts from her hands. In her powered-up state, her strength, durability and energy blasts are even more powerful. Her base power level was on-par with Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). During the events of Avengers: Endgame, she held her own against Thanos (Josh Brolin), who only faced real competition against Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) up to that point. While Captain Marvel is powerful, there is plenty of debate about whether or not she’s even the strongest Avenger, let alone the most powerful superhero in the MCU.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>In comparison, Goku is, without a doubt, the strongest character in anime. He is anime’s answer to Superman—an alien sent to Earth as a baby with enough power to destroy all life on the planet. Lucky for us, they both became Earth’s protector, and Goku has saved the human race from certain destruction more times than he can probably count.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Goku’s abilities are immense, starting with super speed and super strength, like Captain Marvel. However, Goku can move faster than the human eye can detect, even at his base form. His many powers include the kaioken attack, spirit bomb and his famous kamehameha, which is strong enough to destroy a planet. Throughout the years, Goku has gone through many transformations—each of them stronger than the one before—and his latest transformation into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultra Instinct</a> form makes him closer to a god than mortal.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>Therefore, without any doubt, Goku would destroy Captain Marvel in combat. In fact, as powerful as all the Z Fighters are, Captain Marvel might only be able to beat Yamcha.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqitnJl6qLvKrmSbnZGpeqO%2ByJ5kpZmiqLyvv4ycmKmskZ67brnAq62epF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bobby-lashley-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Bobby Lashley Net Worth: A Wrestling Phenomenon with a $5 Million Net Worth</span></a>
