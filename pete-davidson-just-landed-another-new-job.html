According to <a href=#>People</a>, Davidson is the new face of the intimate trimmer and groomer company, Manscaped. In <a href=#>a new ad</a>, Davidson exclaims, "Let's show them how hairless we could be, boys,"&nbsp;while also adding, "Presentation matters! Don't make me get specific 'cause I will." He jokes, "Shave it, baby."&nbsp;</p><p>For those who have been paying attention, personal grooming is also very important to the Kardashians. Khloé Kardashian hinted that her sister Kim Kardashian favors a landscaped look herself when she said in 2015 (via <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a>), "I know Kim is completely bare, and now she says she wishes she still had a lil' somethin' going on but she lasered it all off."&nbsp;</p><p>Kim also told People (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>) that she was once self-conscious of the hair on her forehead.&nbsp;"If you Google 2008 or 2007, I had the craziest, hairiest hairline, so I did laser it. Everyone would just Photoshop it every time I did a photo shoot [anyway]," she said at the time. With that said, we imagine that Davidson and Kim are probably now bonding over their personal care routines. The couple that grooms together stays together, right?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmpka316e8%2Beq55llJbDqrDSqKVmoqWowW64wKebnpxdlruwwMeeqWamlax6q7vBaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brooke-valentine-son-special-needs-father-not-disclosed.html><span>←</span><span>London, son of Brooke Valentine</span></a>
