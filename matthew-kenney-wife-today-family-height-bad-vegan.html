Fraud. Fugitives that dropped on Netflix on 16 March 2022. The show explores how the runaway fugitive <a href=#>Sarma Melngailis</a>, aka the Queen of Vegan Cuisine, ran one of the hottest restaurants in New York, a raw-food vegan place called Pure Food and Wine for years. That is of course before she ended up defrauding her employees and running from law enforcement. Matthew Kenney, whom we are going to discuss in the rest of the writing, is a celebrated chef who played a significant role in Pure Food and Wine becoming a reality and Sarma becoming the “Queen of Vegan Cuisine”.</p><p>Now, read through this ‘Matthew Kenney Bio’.</p><h3>Matthew Kenney On Netflix’s Bad Vegan</h3><p>Matthew, here, is the world’s leading plant-based chef, the writer of several best-selling cookbooks, a culinary educator, and an entrepreneur specializing in the plant-based lifestyle. This is how Matthew Kenny’s story advances on Bad Vegan.</p><p>After graduating from the French Culinary Institute, he was working in several restaurants where meat and dairy-based food was the mainstay when he got an invite to work at a raw food restaurant in the East Village in New York. The timing was perfect because Matthew was already considering shifting to plant-based cuisine. So, around this time, in 2003, he crossed paths with Sarma when she was hired to research for one of his cookbooks. They released the cookbook titled Raw Food, Real World: 100 Recipes to Get the Glow. It&nbsp;became a surprise hit and opened a lot of doors for the pair.</p><p>They began dating and, in 2004, co-launched Pure Food and Wine, which was soon going to bring about the food revolution and later the controversy of an era, with <a href=#>Jeffrey Chodorow</a> as its owner.</p><p>Regardless, by late 2005, not just Matthew and Sarma had ended their relationship, and Matthew even had left the restaurant.</p><p>Jeffrey had sued Matthew for an alleged breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. While Jeffrey considered that Matthew was poaching Pure Food and Wine’s employees to work on his other projects; Matthew, in his defense, said the employees were the ones to contact him. (Of course) he also denied all accusations.</p><h3><strong>Where Is Matthew Kenney Today?</strong></h3><p>Post Pure Food and Wine, Matthew ran several restaurants in Oklahoma, Maine, Illinois, and California at different times. All along, he also continued dealing with legal troubles and financial issues at many of his establishments.</p><p>In 2009, Matthew had notably started a culinary institute that specialized in raw food, with students from all over the globe coming to study there.
