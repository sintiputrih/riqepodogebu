When it reached Netflix, the damage had already been done, and the film’s reputation was unsalvageable, despite the allure of Ana de Armas as Marilyn Monroe. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The divisiveness doesn’t deter the star, however, who believes Blonde is misunderstood.</a></p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>“It was not a movie that was made to please people or to make people like it,” de Armas told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. Blonde takes from Joyce Carol Oates’s novel of the same name to tackle Monroe’s historically scrutinized public life, but, the Oscar nominee is right, it doesn’t do it in any kind of pleasing way, because Monroe’s life was far from pleasing either.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Instead, Dominik doubles down on the objectification of the famous actress as the sex symbol, the pin-up, and the blonde bombshell, in a constant tug of war with the aspirations of an increasingly disenchanted Norma Jean. To do this, Blonde is shamelessly graphic, sexual and violent. In the words of de Armas, “It is a hard movie to watch.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/blonde-netflix-e1663962131675.png><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>The actress, who has gone on to receive an Academy Award nomination for the role, doesn’t think her director’s approach is a disservice to Monroe, but quite the opposite. By not holding back, Blonde is exposing the true horrors of the industry that both built and destroyed that who was possibly the biggest star of the 20th Century. “That’s a hard pill to swallow sometimes for other people in the business,” she continued.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>The main point of contention was never with how the industry is portrayed in the film, though, but rather the arguably excessive torture porn Dominik puts the image and memory of a dead woman through. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The question remains if the two are indeed inseparable, or if there really was a more respectful way to effectively portray just how horribly Hollywood treated Monroe.</a></p><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=864 data-injectable=true>De Armas argued that there’s yet another layer of meta meaning to Blonde, based in the role the audiences have always played in the well-oiled machine that is the entertainment industry. Complacent at best, accomplices and even perpetrators at worst. “I feel like the movie also makes the audience feel like participants. We contributed at the time, and we still contribute, in the exploitation of actors, people in the public eye. We, the audience, do this,” the actress said.</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=124 data-injectable=false>“I feel like it’s possible that some people have felt like [someone] pointed a finger at [them], de Armas concluded.</p><p data-characters=31 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>Blonde is streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKeZXZmybq3RppisZaKawLG7zZ2qZqyfYq%2Btu82dnGaakZi4ra3SoWSirF2srrR5zairZqWRmbJuwM5mp6WdkaiybrzEqKelnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-romo-and-candice-crawford-a-journey-of-love-and-support-in-the-spotlight.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Romo and Candice Crawford: A Journey of Love and Support in the Spotlight</span></a>
