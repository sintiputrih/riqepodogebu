I had a debilitating stutter as a kid that I overcame by reading and reciting Irish poems.</p><p>2. Growing up, my family’s political connections didn’t extend to the local school board — I was the first senator I ever knew.</p><p>3. One of my favorite jobs was working at a public pool in Wilmington, Delaware.</p><p>4. I was elected to the Senate at age 29, but turned the constitutionally required age of 30 before being sworn in.</p><p>5. I love baseball and football, and was one of the leading scorers on our undefeated football team during my senior year.</p><p>6. If I had a different career — and the talent — I’d have been an architect.</p><p>7. I love Corvettes and still own a 1967 Corvette that my dad financed for me as a wedding <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a>.</p><p>8. One of my biggest accomplishments in the Senate was writing and passing the Violence Against Women Act.</p><p>9. Some of my closest friends from the Senate have been Republicans — folks like <b>Bob Dole</b> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John McCain.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/joe-biden-john-mccain-fec214c5-43cf-482e-a10f-baa46c878572.jpg><p>10. As the chairman or lead Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, I’ve overseen more Supreme Court nominations than any other living person.</p><p>11. My biggest vice is chocolate chip ice cream, no mint.</p><p>12. My wife, Jill, is a Philly girl and a die-hard Flyers fan.</p><p>13. Jill and I have a German shepherd, Champ.</p><p>14. I wear small rosary beads around my wrist, the ones my son Beau wore the day he passed.</p><p>15. I’ve had a rule since the Senate: I will interrupt any meeting, even with the president, if my children or grandchildren call.</p><p>16. I’ve been focused on foreign policy my whole career, and have flown more than 1.1 million miles on Air Force 2 since becoming VP.</p><p>17. I not only serve with the president, but we are close personal friends — as are our families. His children and my grandchildren are best friends.</p><p>18. I always have Ray-Ban aviators, which I’ve been wearing since I was a lifeguard in the ’60s, on me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/joe-biden-sunglasses-d4d026b7-6cfe-4710-884f-fff5261f2a51.jpg><p>19. I like working out and try to do it regularly.</p><p>20. My younger sister, Valerie, has managed all of my campaigns.</p><p>21. My father said we must stand up to the worst sin: abuse of power. This has been the guiding principle of my career.</p><p>22. I love meeting children when I’m on the road. It brightens my day!</p><p>23. My favorite drink is orange Gatorade.</p><p>24. My favorite meal is pasta.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. My biggest accomplishment is my family. Jill has taught community college full-time while serving as second lady. My daughter Ashley has a master’s of social work and heads the largest criminal-justice nonprofit in Delaware. My son Hunter s a lawyer and runs World Food Program USA. And my son Beau was attorney general of Delaware and a decorated war veteran.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavoZOaerG%2BxKygnZ2eqXqru8RmmaKclaN6c4GMrZ%2Bippeoerq71GabqKakYrivu9ZmmJunpal6rrGMsGlpbmhugHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nuface-mini-device-review-6745861.html><span>←</span><span>NuFACE's Mini+ Microcurrent Is the Skin Tightening Device You Need</span></a>
