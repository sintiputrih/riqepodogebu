Harry even phoned his father on his birthday earlier this month during which the two reportedly had a "warm conversation" that ended up being a "turning point" for royal father-and-son duo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It really hit home how he should try to work through this for the children’s sake," a source told OK!, per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Marie Claire</a>. "Charles knows he doesn’t have many more birthdays or Christmases left and wants to try to repair the rift so that his grandchildren will be a part of the family like everyone else."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But it hasn't been as easy for Harry to mend his relationships with the other family members. The insider adds that Harry's memoir, Spare, which came out in January, did not sit well with his older brother Prince William or their step-mother (and King Charles's wife), Queen Camilla. So, you could say that Charles is stuck between a rock and a hard place since he's hoping to fix his relationship with his younger son.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There is virtually no chance of mending the damage between his two sons,"&nbsp;the source told the outlet.&nbsp;"The Queen&nbsp;is also still very deeply hurt by the comments made about her and that’s another obstacle for Charles to overcome."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The whole ordeal has been "painful and traumatic" for Charles, according to royal author and expert Tom Bower. "For Charles, the whole thing has been painful and traumatic," Bower told the outlet. "The problem is that Harry and Meghan have caused so much damage, it’s hard to imagine how to repair it. But I’m sure that the King would like a solution."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Charles has not only got William and Kate [to think of], but he’s also got Camilla, who was very insulted by&nbsp;Harry and Meghan&nbsp;too, so that makes it a great problem for him," he added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This news comes a week after royal author and expert Omid Scobie revealed that the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brothers are not on speaking terms</a> — and may never be again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Absolutely nothing has changed,”&nbsp;Scobie told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a> while promoting his new <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>book,&nbsp;Endgame</a>. “I saw Harry’s release of&nbsp;Spare&nbsp;as his last attempt at telling his family how he’s felt for years. Because clearly, there’s never been an open enough forum to have these conversations or share these feelings.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yqKloGWTna6zuMSsZKqtlZq7bq%2FApqClpJFivbO1zZycZqCRp7%2B6ecOrmKaZXW2BcYGWb2o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-weaver.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Weaver - In Relation, Bio, Career , Age, Net Worth, Facts</span></a>
